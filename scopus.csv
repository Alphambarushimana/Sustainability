However, there are few studies in Nigeria on how EM practices have been used in the hotel industry for their survival and growth. The study examines the customer-centric influence of EM on business performance of hotels in Nigeria during the COVID-19 crisis. Using a cross-sectional survey design, we collected primary data from 578 owner-managers and top managers of 66 hotels in Lagos and Yola in Nigeria using structured questionnaires. Respondents were selected based on the purposive sampling technique. The data collected were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics with the aid of statistical package for social sciences (SPSS Version 21). Three regression estimations are reported. The estimation in model 1 indicates that calculated risk-taking dimension has a significant positive influence on general performance, while the proactiveness, innovativeness, value creation, resource leveraging, opportunity to focus and customer intensity dimensions do not. The estimation in model 2 suggests that calculated risk-taking and customer intensity dimensions have a significant positive influence on revenue per room, while the other five EM dimensions do not. The estimation in model 3 indicates that calculated risk-taking dimension has a significant positive influence on market share, while the six EM dimensions do not. The owner-mangers and top managers of hotels should fortify and upscale the weak EM dimensions as a resilience strategy for recovery from the ravages of the COVID-19 crisis. We bridge the gaps in the literature by providing interesting insights into the potential value of the adoption of EM as a post-COVID-19 recovery strategy by the hotel segment of the hospitality industry in the developing context of Nigeria. We also validate the applicability of RBT in predicting the influence of EM dimensions on performance in the developing context. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Customers; Entrepreneurial marketing; Hotels; Nigeria; Resource-based theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130242980

The multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary nature of ICTs means that the ICT literature is published in several fields of knowledge. Although Bradford’s law of dispersion is commonly used to determine the core journals in a given field or discipline or topic of study, this study attempts to use the principles of the law to determine the core concepts of ICTs within the information and knowledge management literature. Data was obtained from EBSCO Discovery’s Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts (LISTA) and the Library and Information Science Source (LISS) databases using a variety of keywords as search terms. The procedures of conducting a Bradford analysis were followed to determine the core subject terms in ICTs as reflected in the IKM group of articles published between 1998 and 2017. The results indicate that the application of ICTs in IKM largely occurs in the fields medicine, business and commerce, education and training (higher education and training), decision sciences, and industrial management. It was also noted that the core subjects varied from one study period to another; technology-associated subject terms were largely visible; and the dispersion of subject terms fits the Bradford’s dispersion. We however noted that the dispersion of articles according to Bradford’s zones is not accurately representative of the principles of the Law. The study has implications for collection development, searching and retrieval practices, and the application of Bradford’s law beyond the analysis of core journals or publications in not only IKM but also in the field of library and information science. © 2022, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130210323

Covid-19 vaccines are one of the most crucial innovations that help fight against the virus. This paper attempts to revisit the Covid-19 vaccines production process by employing the serendipity-mindsponge-3D creativity management theory. Vaccine production can be considered an information process and classified into three main stages. The first stage involved the processes of absorbing information (e.g., digital data and open science) and rejecting unhelpful information (e.g., misinformation and fake news) for effectively acquiring useful insights. Useful insights were later employed by experts, enterprises, governments, and international organizations through interdisciplinary coordinated efforts for developing vaccines within a short period. Finally, the appearance of multiple types of vaccines enabled more strategic options for vaccine distribution and administration. Findings from this vaccine creativity management process could be used as critical lessons for further improvements of vaccination programs. © 2022, The Author(s).",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123110128

The multi-agent system consists of three main parts: Model, Routing Algorithms and Platform. The case study of cleaning urban areas in the city of Split with electric cleaners is used to evaluate the multi-agent system. The model consists of three main entities: Electric Vehicle, Charging Station and Depot. The electric vehicle is defined more generally to ensure the application and reusability of the model in different business and research domains. The routing algorithms of the multi-agent system are defined with artificial intelligence utilization models. The utilization models predict the use of parking lots and charging stations, based on which the routing algorithms navigate the electric vehicles in the space. The utilization models use the CatBoost machine learning method and a contextually enriched dataset that uses point-of-interest data as context. The multi-agent platform for contextual routing of electric vehicles is used for validation and evaluation of multi-agent models and comparative analysis of routing algorithms under defined contextual conditions. Using context-aware routing algorithms, the multi-agent system for the case study showed a 5.6% improvement in urban cleaning operations and an 18.5% improvement in vehicle charging at charging stations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Contextually enriched data; Data science; Electric vehicle routing problem; Multi-agent system; Sustainable urban operations","Cost effectiveness; Electric vehicles; Fleet operations; Learning systems; Reusability; Vehicle routing; Case-studies; Charging station; Context-Aware; Contextually enriched data; Electric vehicle routing problem; Routings; Sustainable urban operation; Urban operations; Vehicle fleets; Vehicle Routing Problems; Multi agent systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138105917

Fourth Generation Management arises as a systems-based approach for managing contemporary businesses before the advent of Industry 4.0 and during low awareness of the Circular Economy. While 4th Generation Management provides value to business by considering several resources, stakeholders, and interactions, making businesses customer-oriented, it fails to address the sustainability issue for contemporary businesses in the current context of Industry 4.0, Circular Economy, Competitiveness, and Stakeholders. Indeed, it fails to make businesses more contemporary (i.e., more open and sustainable) to adapt to their context. Moreover, in the literature, there is no work discussing how Sustainability, Industry 4.0, Circular Economy, Competitiveness, and diverse Stakeholders as contemporary issues are accounted for in business management. The main aim of this study is to propose a Re-engineered 4th Generation Management as a systems-based approach, enabling today's business to be oriented toward customer and sustainability. We have reviewed 181 articles published between 2005 and 2022 from Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases to pursue such a goal. The novelty of this work relies on presenting a systems-based approach, which is best suited for sustainable businesses in the context of Industry 4.0 digitalization technologies (e.g., Artificial intelligence, Blockchain, Cloud computing, and Big data analytics), Circular Economy, Stakeholders, and Competitiveness. Furthermore, propositions are formulated to reflect on the suggested framework based on recent literature.

Unfortunately, we also observe a hype where the models’ business deployability is reduced to simplistic technical metrics, namely, the model's prediction accuracy. This study argues that this is a misleading oversimplification of the financial sector's business realities as it ignores vital dimensions such as the model's economic viability. Therefore, we develop a framework for evaluating the business deployability of UGDF models for consumer credit using a design science research methodology.

The purpose of this paper is to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Overall 50 students from two universities in Spain and the United Kingdom, enrolled on two different degree courses (Global Studies and Marketing), cooperated in multidisciplinary teams to analyze real development policies and initiatives. The authors collected quantitative and qualitative data to assess the students' perceptions of the methodology. Findings: The students perceived the VE to be of great value, enriching their educational experience by having a positive effect on their overall learning and fostering internationalization. A high number of participants declared the teaching and learning methodology was useful to assist them in reaching crucial cognitive, skill-based and affective educational objectives, and to help them understand how development policy works while also raising awareness regarding real-world complexity. Practical implications: This methodology proved valuable in helping students acquire the set of skills expected from today's graduates in economics, political science and marketing. This active learning and pedagogical innovation component provides some interesting conclusions contributing toward widening the adoption of VEs in higher education contexts. Originality/value: The increasing complexity of the globalized world makes it challenging for higher education institutions to develop multidisciplinary approaches to education to foster sustainable development.

However, its successful implementation poses one of the most relevant challenges to the Industry 4.0. According to recent surveys, 80%–87% of data science projects never make it to production. Regardless of the low deployment success rate, more than 75% of investors are maintaining or increasing their investments in artificial intelligence (AI). To help quality decision-makers improve the current situation, this paper aims to review Process Monitoring for Quality (PMQ), a Quality 4.0 initiative, along with its practical and managerial implications. Furthermore, a real case study is presented to demonstrate its application. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed Quality 4.0 initiative improves conventional quality control methods by monitoring a process and detecting defective items in real time. Defect detection is formulated as a binary classification problem. Using the same path of Six Sigma define, measure, analyze, improve, control, Quality 4.0-based innovation is guided by Identify, Acsensorize, Discover, Learn, Predict, Redesign and Relearn (IADLPR2) – an ad hoc seven-step problem-solving approach. Findings: The IADLPR2 approach has the ability to identify and solve engineering intractable problems using AI. This is especially intriguing because numerous quality-driven manufacturing decision-makers consistently cite difficulties in developing a business vision for this technology. Practical implications: From the proposed method, quality-driven decision-makers will learn how to launch a Quality 4.0 initiative, while quality-driven engineers will learn how to systematically solve intractable problems through AI.

Design/methodology/approach: This study is cross-sectional and adopted a mixed method approach. Data was gathered through a questionnaire survey of 212 business owner–managers that are members of the Uganda Small Scale Industries Association (USSIA) and engaging 8 business managers in the in-depth interviews to support and strengthen the quantitative results. Data analysis was done using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS.24) and Atlas ti.8. Findings: The study reveals that social media perception, readiness and usage positively influence sustainable growth of MSEs in Uganda. However, the insufficient soft and technical skills, lack of devices such as computers and smartphones and the high cost of Internet data undermine the usage of social media by business owner–managers for sustainable growth of their businesses. Practical implications: The findings demonstrate what policymakers, social media operators and business owner–managers need to do to enhance integration of social media platforms and channels into the operations of MSEs in Uganda. Originality/value: This study adds to existing literature on social media technology in MSEs with evidence from Uganda. The study results are likely to foster usage of social media as policymakers and social media providers will come up with appropriate strategies to unlock the social media potential of the business owner–managers for sustainable business growth in Uganda. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","MSEs; Owner–managers; Readiness; Social media perception; Sustainable growth; Uganda; Usage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129213979

Undoubtedly, this expansion has aroused keen interest among the representatives of a range of areas such as science, politics and business. The purpose of this paper is to describe the scope, the key players and the main investment strategies of the Islamic finance market based on the evidence obtained from Kyrgyzstan. Design/methodology/approach: The main empirical corpus was formed from Bureau van Dijk’s databases (Zephyr and Orbis) and includes approximately 80 deals involving Shariah-compliant investments in Kyrgyzstan from 1991 to 2020. The initial corpus was then significantly expanded by means of content analysis of open media sources. Being still insufficient for deeper generalization, these data were further complemented by the analysis of an array of corporate information (press releases, presentations and financial reports) related to the identified deals. To ensure the credibility of the conclusions to be made on the nature of Islamic finance in Kyrgyzstan, the desk analysis was also complemented with field research using qualitative method of in-depth expert interviews. Findings: This paper has shown that despite the yet modest market volumes represented by Islamic bank, Islamic windows, Islamic leasing company and microfinance companies, Islamic finance in Kyrgyz Republic has further growth prospects, which are associated with the arrival of large foreign Islamic banks that bring innovative financial products, the issuance of Islamic securities (sukuk) and launch of Islamic insurance (takaful). Being more open and consistent in the development of Islamic finance industry, the authorities of Kyrgyzstan understand the need for the initial development of the market by their own forces. Originality/value: This paper is original and up-to-date, as it contains new and significant information. Suggesting a new approach to studying Islamic finance in post-Soviet area, this paper identifies the most active Islamic investors in Kyrgyzstan, classifies them, reveals their investment strategies and assesses the financial performance of Islamic investors as well as the total volume of Shariah-compliant capital in Kyrgyzstan. The findings of this paper can contribute to shaping policies toward Islamic finance in the post-Soviet region and, therefore, may be beneficial to the development of Islamic finance industry. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Islamic banking; Islamic leasing (ijarah); Islamic microfinance; Islamic securities (sukuk); Kyrgyzstan; post-Soviet studies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131720272

Tsenov Academy of Economics, Svishtov, 5250, Bulgaria","In recent years, modern society has faced a number of challenges related to the achievement of global goals for sustainable development. Industrial enterprises are challenged to generate, stimulate, and demand changes in networks and supply chains, but these challenges require flexibility and innovation activity in different directions. The data for Bulgaria show that the country is last among the countries of the European Union in terms of the creation and implementation of eco-innovations. Despite this result, the pace at which the country is developing shows that in the next few years, Bulgaria has the potential to move from a modest to a moderate eco-innovator, provided that it succeeds in filling the structural gaps in the system of ecological innovation. These gaps are related not only to the need for changes in the investment of resources but also to the need for changes in individual and related systems such as science and innovation, support for SMEs, the energy system, etc. Most of the research on sustainable innovation and eco-innovation has, however, focused on firm innovation models dominated by short-term profit-maximizing approaches. Therefore, there is a need to conduct research and propose adequate strategies for modern business environments and design models that facilitate the implementation of eco-innovations in industrial enterprises. The purpose of this report is to investigate the factors influencing the development of eco-innovation activities of Bulgarian industrial enterprises, examining how they can help to achieve success through eco-innovation and improve business results. A factorial model is proposed, through which the relationships between technological, financial, organizational, informational resources, research and development activities (R&D), and company cooperation are analyzed. The PLS structural equation modeling technique was used to validate the proposed theoretical model. The survey was conducted among 380 industrial enterprises from all over the sectors of the economy in Bulgaria with the help of a specially developed questionnaire within the period of April 2019 to December 2021. The obtained results show that human resources, financial resources, and cooperation positively influence research and development activities. In addition, the achievement of a positive effect on the management of eco-innovations affects the innovation activities of industrial enterprises, their ability to carry out research and development activities, as well as their ability to manage the technical and technological resources at their disposal effectively. Finally, the innovation activity aimed at carrying out scientific research and development activity, products and processes obtained as a result of the eco-innovation activity, and adequate information management directly affect the efficiency of business processes and financial results. © 2022 by the authors.","eco-efficiency; eco-innovation; eco-innovation activity; industrial enterprises; innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138642012

Policy-makers have encouraged the co-location of technology-based firms that could lead to innovation benefits. One of the innovation policies are science parks, area developments where technology-based firms, universities and research institutes co-locate. Science parks enable firms to focus on their core activities. However, the trade-off that technology-based firms make regarding the science park location choice and the impact of organisational characteristics on these trade-offs is unknown. To collect tenant preference data, an exploratory survey with a stated choice experiment is distributed among technology-based firms both on and off science parks in the Netherlands. This approach allows for the estimation of the utilities that firms assign to design-related attributes and their willingness to pay for these attributes. Results show that science park tenants prefer locations with universities within the same area, shared business support and leisure facilities and near station locations relatively more than off-park counterparts do. Tenant firms are most eager to pay for the proximity of the university followed by provided R&D facilities, accessibility of the location, provided shared facilities, technological focus of the area and lastly events held in the area. © 2022 The Authors","Preference; Science park; Stated choice experiment; Technology-based firm; Trade-off","Economic and social effects; Parks; Colocations; Location choice; Policy makers; Preference; Science park; Stated choice experiments; Sustainable economy; Technology development; Technology-based firms; Trade off; Location; location decision; preference behavior; research and development; technological development; willingness to pay; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132332585

Using data from 23 in-depth interviews with HCPs (physicians and pharmacists) and MSLs in Thailand, we show that e-detailing fosters self-governance as a practice. The data identify how FPSMT, as privatized social media managed by large firms, represents a tool for self-governance that is articulated by expert professionals along three cognitive frames: aspiration, regulation, and responsibilisation. Through FPSMT, professionals in highly regulated B2B ecosystems engage in self-governance practice to develop pooled views that are influenced by personal and collective rules. The perspective on self-governance as a practice that is offered allows to understand how B2B network governance rely on professionals’ engagement to foster aspirations for the collective agenda, beyond the narrow pursuit of sales’ objectives. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.","B2B; Healthcare; Network governance; Self-governance; Social media technology; Technological framing; Thailand",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094650580

Nonetheless, there is still uncertainty about several aspects of the relationship between volunteerism and the corporate realm and research on the relationship between CV and employer attractiveness is scarce. This study aims to attempt to fill this gap by studying the influence that the perceived importance attributed by prospective applicants to the opportunity of engaging in CV programs may have on employer attractiveness while also pondering the existence of an indirect relationship between CV and employer attractiveness mediated by the individual cognition of corporate morality (CM). Design/methodology/approach: To fulfill the objectives of this research, and test its hypothesized model, the authors opted to use a quantitative methodology via survey by questionnaire of Portuguese students who are close to entering the job-seeking process or are currently involved in it, either passively and actively. Data on 238 Portuguese students was collected mainly through social media channels such as LinkedIn and Facebook and was analyzed with the IBM SPSS Statistics 25 software and the IBM SPSS AMOS extension, using a structural equation model to test the hypotheses and obtain insight into the relationships between the variables. Findings: A theoretical model was elaborated based on the literature reviewed and was used to validate the existence of a positive direct relationship between CV and employer attractiveness, CV and CM and between CM and employer attractiveness. Finally, it was observed that CV could prompt an indirect effect on the socioethical perception of employer attractiveness, mainly due to the mediating mechanism of the individual cognition of CM. Research limitations/implications: This study has some limitations that should be acknowledged and considered in future studies, namely, the diversity of the sample, as it was essentially formed by students enrolled in the University of Porto and studying mainly in the areas of social sciences, trade and law. It is also worth noting that a global analysis of the employer attractiveness attributes was not considered, focusing instead on the social and ethical spectrum of employer attractiveness. Nonetheless, it is important to keep in mind that different individuals prioritize distinct attractiveness attributes. Practical implications: Through the present study, it was understood that CV programs constitute a desired and pertinent tool that should be adopted by firms (employers) to establish a strong position in the job market. These findings are particularly useful for the area of human resources management, which is in charge of finding the most adequate applicants in the job market. Furthermore, for the variable of CM, the authors noticed that there is a theoretical lack of measurement instruments. Consequently, the measure advanced in this study represents an important theoretical and methodologic contribution to the literature. Social implications: CV is a concept that is yet maturing within the Portuguese business environment. As such, this study delivers useful insights regarding Portuguese applicants’ growing interest around CV, their concerns about the social, ethical and humanitarian attributes of firms and their beliefs regarding the morality of firms’ social policies and actions. Hence, it allowed us to comprehend that by developing a structured CV program, an employer may be able to enhance other essential concepts for Portuguese prospective applicants, respectively, employer attractiveness and CM. Originality/value: This study corroborates the premise that corporate community involvement activities, namely, CV, hold a positive effect in terms of perceived employer attractiveness. Moreover, it is consistent with the idea that CV programs foment a feeling of intimacy between individuals and firms, consequently creating a perception of morality as part of the firms’ intrinsic traits. Finally, it corroborates and extends for the case of prospective applicants the conclusion that individuals may be relatively more concerned with the motives behind firms’ corporate social responsibility practices than with the content of such practices. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate morality; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate volunteering; Employer attractiveness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111901977

Managing political uncertainty and attaining greater accuracy in risk analysis of a country's political environment remain a challenge. Our research attempts to fill this gap by re-directing scholarly attention from the questions of what and why to how political uncertainty and political risks can be identified and assessed by (1) offering a process-based theoretical framework of a country's political environment that explicitly incorporates its dynamic structure; and (2) proposing a new methodological framework based on DFA to empirically estimate it. We demonstrate how DFA enables evaluating the country's political environment, in terms of: (1) complexity of the political environment, (2) potency (or importance) of the dimensions of the political environment; (3) stability of the political environment, and (4) nomological validity of the model. To demonstrate the application of this methodology, we analyze Brazil's political environment for the period 1984–2018 using monthly political risk time-series data. The paper then maps Brazil's political environment using political science scholarship with our empirical results triangulating the insights.

How risk is understood and managed has a substantial impact upon which films are financed, produced and seen. Founded on substantial original research accessing the highest level of industry practitioners, this book examines the intertwined activity of independents, large media companies including major studios, the international marketplace, and related audio-visual sectors such as high-end television. The book shows how risk is generally framed, or even intuited, rather than calculated, and that this process occurs across a sliding scale of formality. This work goes beyond broad creative industries characterisations of a ""risky sector"" and concentrations on Box Office return modelling, to provide a missing middle. This means a coherent analytic coverage of business organisation and project construction to address the complex practicalities that mobilise strategic operations in relation to risk, often in unseen business-to-business contexts. Informed by economic sociology's concepts addressing market assemblage and valuation, alongside applications of science and technology studies to media and communications, the book respects both the powerful roles of social and institutional actors, and affordances of new technologies in dealing with the persistent known unknown - the audience. Examining a persistent business issue in a new way, this book analyses top level industry practice through established mechanisms, and innovations like data analytics. The result is a book that will be essential reading for scholars with an interest in the film business as well as risk management more broadly. © 2023 Michael Franklin.

Carrying out demand forecasts means reconfiguring behavioral patterns in historical series and predicting future behavior or, furthermore, identifying causal factors that affect behavior and extrapolate it. The objective of this article is to carry out a review of the literature on two demand forecasting methods with the purpose of bringing together the methods and models available on two concepts currently used in the administration of companies related to the consumption and production of products and services. The methodology used is a review of the literature with a qualitative approach, with the purpose of giving a general descriptive view of two dominant methods used in forecasting demand. The mapping of the literature was carried out to identify the state of science through the scientific production available in the Scopus and Google Scholar data banks. Qualitative methods and causes are more associated with forecasts of medium and long terms. In the analysis of time series, as the methods, two different types of means and exponential smoothing are indicated as the most suitable for short-term forecasts. A resource used in various realities is the construction of its own demand forecasting model, or one that uses techniques, aspects, concepts and characteristics of different methods and models.

In recent years, numerous methods have been proposed for analyzing structured process data. In many cases, however, only the digitized parts of processes are directly captured by process-aware information systems, whereas manual activities often leave blind spots in the process analysis. While video data can contain valuable process-related information that is not captured in information systems, a standardized approach to extracting event logs from unstructured video data remains lacking. To solve this problem and facilitate the systematic usage of video data in process mining, we have designed the ViProMiRA, a reference architecture that bridges the gap between computer vision and process mining. The various evaluation activities in our design science research process ensure that the proposed ViProMiRA allows flexible, use case-driven, and context-specific instantiations. Our results also show that a prototypical implementation of the ViProMiRA is capable of automatically extracting more than 70% of the process-relevant events from a real-world video dataset in a supervised learning scenario. © 2022","computer vision; process mining; reference architecture; unstructured data","Bridges; Computer architecture; Computer vision; Enterprise resource management; Information systems; Information use; Video recording; Blind spots; Process analysis; Process data; Process mining; Process-aware information systems; Reference architecture; Shedding light; Structured process; Unstructured data; Video data; Data mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129825456

This has necessitated a new line of research on competency building, transparency, and sustainability in automotive supply chains. In this study, the authors examine the competencies required to improve the automotive supply chain routine operations to address the parts supply crisis from multitier suppliers in the post-COVID-19 environment. The authors also propose a list of competencies required in the automotive supply chains to deploy the transparency for sustainability (TfS) framework on a long-term basis. Design/methodology/approach: The authors have adapted a cross-case study process using intervention-based research and a design science approach for use in this study and used multiple sources for data collection such as published literature, operational experience, and critical opinions of original equipment manufacturer representatives. The research design includes interviews with global OEMs practitioners as one of the relevant sources of information. Findings: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak on automotive manufacturing operations and global supply chains is unprecedented. The TfS framework cycle has been validated using the real-world semiconductor supply crisis which deals with multitier sustainable supply chain management (MTSSCM), and the authors found that there are competency gaps when compared with existing literature. The list of key competencies identified along with the formulation of design propositions to facilitate both the supply crisis and collaboration among automotive firms to enhance their business performance were also presented. Research limitations/implications: The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the automobile sector significantly. This situation has created many opportunities and obstacles, but this paper only considers the automotive semi-conductor shortage situation, which may be resolved in the near future when there are more installed capacities. Therefore, it is unclear whether the proposed responses will result in long-term solutions. Further adjustments may be needed to revisit the TfS framework. The research paper only addresses the automotive side of the current supply crisis, but more sustainability issues may arise in the future, which need to be dealt with separately. Practical implications: Research findings may prove particularly interesting to global automotive vehicle manufacturers, suppliers and policy makers who are seeking to understand multitier supply networks to resolve the current challenges associated with the post-COVID-19 pandemic situation. Originality/value: In addition to contributing to developing competency requirements, this study enhances the evolving research stream of MTSSCM by linking it to wider research applications of intervention-based research coupled with design science. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Automotive; COVID-19; Design science; Intervention-based research; Multitier supply chains; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132309098

Practical implications: As the core point of view in strategic management; “achieving and sustaining” competitive advantage in organizations always takes an important place in organizational survival. With the help mentioned proposes stakeholders of the system could understand the ways of dealing with the complexities of new business world which enhances organizational competitiveness. Social implications: Maritime business could be defined as a social ecosystem which has it is own dynamics and customs. Socio-eco systems, like all complex systems, show unique non-linear dynamics in space and time which could be tough to define via classical quantitative methods. Organizations co-exist and co-evolve with their environment. It is possible that organizations effect their environment and gain some control over it while at the same time affected from environment and should steer the new trends.

The pandemic of the last two years has accelerated the growth and importance of digital media and sales channels – another typically siloed team – in how customers research, consider and buy. Change is not only taking place in more obvious consumer markets, but also in B2B, where both customers and suppliers have been forced to move more of sales and service processes online. This is delivering surprisingly positive outcomes in many cases, with McKinsey’s research showing that buyers and sellers alike prefer the new digital reality.2 As the need to connect ‘base nurturing’ activities (which tend to be owned by sales departments) and ‘growth activities’ (usually led by marketers) becomes clearer and as the digitalisation of both sale and marketing becomes more mainstream, we are seeing the re-birth of the ownership of ‘line of sight to results’ across functional silos. This is happening with the creation of roles such as Chief Growth Officer, Chief Customer Officer and new-style CMOs or CSOs who take a data-first approach and tend to look further than their own discipline along the entire value chain for the customer. This hybrid position bridges traditional departmental silos such as business development, sales, marketing, operations, customer support and information technology. While those organisations are striving to understand their customers’ omni-channel jouneys and add value all the way across this complex ecosystem of interactions, some historical models of analysis may no longer be able to cope with today’s cross-silo, omni-channel reality that requires end-to-end insights for many teams across the business. In this article we examine various useful, relevant, data science based approaches on which modern executives can rely to understand this new interconnected reality, allowing them to understand, nurture and grow their customer relationships, even in times of uncertainty and rapid change. We use examples of how traditionally marketing department-led activities such as customer segmentation and marketing investment analysis can evolve into a more cross-functional approach delivering better insights and, importantly, more value to the business. © 2022, Henry Stewart Publications.

In countries with relatively young populations such as Turkey, management in family businesses passes into the hands of Generation Y. This study aims to examine the moderator role of the difference between old and new generation Y in the effect of self-efficacy perceptions on decision-making strategies. Design/methodology/approach: This research, which was designed according to the quantitative research method, was designed according to the cross-sectional survey model, one of the general survey models. The research data were collected from a sample of 441 family business managers determined according to the simple random sampling technique. The data were analyzed and interpreted with various statistical techniques. Data analysis was done with AMOS. 20 and International Business Machines statistical package for the social sciences 22 data analysis programs. Findings: According to the analysis findings, there is a significant relationship between the participants’ self-efficacy perceptions and decision-making strategies. Research findings old and new generation Y managers have different decision strategies. The research results showed that the dominant self-efficacy perceptions of the Y generation affect their decision-making strategies. Research limitations/implications: This research only examines whether the old and new generation Y perceptions have a moderator function in the relationship between the participants’ self-efficacy perceptions and decision-making strategies. The research is quantitative research limited to family businesses. The results can be compared by repeating the research with other variables and in different samples, for example, by researching in public institutions. In addition, the way of reflecting the differences in perception to the management can be subjected to deeper analysis with mixed studies. Practical implications: One of the important reasons for the difference in people’s approaches to events is their personality structure. Generational differences, which have been discussed primarily in recent years, make themselves felt in working life. The new working models arising from the different perspectives of the Y generation differ from the traditional business models. Today, in traditional business models, the manager profile is usually the X generation. However, the process is moving toward gaining essential positions in the management levels of the new Y generation. They put traditional managers in a difficult situation with their impatient behavior and desire to climb the career ladder quickly. Social implications: In the studies conducted on the Y generation, it is understood that they do not favor the classical management approach based on the command-command relationship. The sense of loyalty of the Y generation is low compared to other generations and their organizational commitment levels are weak. There are determinations that they attach importance to flexible working style and want to do business using digital technologies. They are highly motivated in setting vision and participating in strategic decisions in organizations. These features differ significantly from the X-generation managers who adopt the traditional management approach. Originality/value: Both emotional and cognitive characteristics influence decision-making behavior. The generation gap which shows common personality structures in a certain period is an important predictor of decision-making strategy. Research results and related studies significantly affect the decision strategies of the generation gap. No research has been found comparing the old and new Y generations. In this respect, it is thought that the research will contribute to theory, practice and method. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Decision; Decision strategies; Decision-making; Decision-making strategies; Generation; Generation Y; Moderating role; New Y generation; Organizational behavior; Self-efficacy perception",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120038303

This study aims to present a systematic review of the literature on CB in areas related to economic and business sciences. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the data from Scopus, Web of Science and a set of articles not indexed to these databases until June 2021, a total of 132 articles were included for analysis, using bibliometric and content analysis techniques. Findings: The study allowed us to identify that CB has four main clusters/themes of research, namely, CB industry and market, marketing and branding, consumer behavior and sustainability. Detailed information on the clusters is provided. In addition, the results showed that publications addressing CB have grown significantly from 2015 onwards and are dispersed across many journals, with none assuming a clear leadership. Quantitative approaches account for more than half of publications. Research limitations/implications: This study is a useful guide for academics intending to develop studies with CB. It provides a framework to structure future research by identifying existing literature clusters and proposes several research propositions. Practical implications: The findings from this study are useful for CB companies to get an overview of the main issues affecting the CB industry and market to be able to adapt their strategies and stay aligned with market tendencies in the four main clusters identified.

This circumstance determines the expansion of the content of the ecosystem approach to the organization of enterprise activities and the clarification of the participants' roles in such systems. The purpose of the study is to identify the key features and differences in business models of digital ecosystem participants that are critical to shaping the value of the distribution system. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, within the framework of the theoretical component, the authors analyze conceptual and empirical articles contained in the Web of Science database and also rely on information obtained from the study of articles by Russian academicians in specialized journals, monographs and conference abstracts. Using the method of content analysis, data on enterprises were collected and generalized into cases, which made it possible to propose possible classification properties of enterprise archetypes within the digital ecosystem and to determine the general properties of the objects under study and their interrelations. Findings: The systematization of results allows us to present a co-competitive activity model for ecosystem participants, depending on their archetype, where they are segmented according to the dominant principle of role and activity within the system. From a practical point of view, the considered classification of the archetypes of recipient enterprises and their economic relations make it possible to structurally visualize a digital ecosystem, which significantly reduces the distance between the consumer of the product/service, the manufacturer and the seller. This reduces the time of delivery and waiting as well as the time to find a suitable option making the market more perfect. The proposed conceptual framework indicates the interdependence of the development of all participants in the product distribution and proves that successful business models take part in the market expansion. Finally, the authors' systematic review of the academic literature results in identifying certain promising directions for future research based on the consideration of open ecosystems with transparent infrastructure. Research limitations/implications: The results are limited by the authors' sample data and the case study approach. The study does not show the further evolution of the digital ecosystem depending on the set and configurations of ecosystem participants. The authors introduce a possible new classification of archetypes of ecosystem participants and a co-competitive activity model for ecosystem participants depending on these archetypes.

Design/methodology/approach: A database of the publications of accounting journals ranked A*, A and B in the Australian Business Dean Council (ABDC) journal rankings from 2009 to 2018 was constructed. A structured literature review, partly using NVivo and Leximancer, analysed the 1,317 articles on developing countries. A parallel online repository contains the research data. Findings: Articles on accounting in developing countries increased by 36% over the ten years but remained a small proportion of all published articles (i.e. 1,317 of 13,805 representing 9.5%). They have concentrated on quantitative market-based studies of financial reporting and auditing, especially in larger and relatively richer developing countries in Asia and Africa, with developed capital markets. Broader topics deemed important in recent reviews of the area, for instance, on achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and on smaller, poorer countries, which have been neglected, albeit less so in qualitative studies. The research identifies important jurisdictional differences. Many authors held positions in British Commonwealth universities. The most cited articles overall, all quantitative, were in highly ranked North American journals, whereas most qualitative studies came from journals located in richer British Commonwealth countries. Research limitations/implications: The study only covers English language journals. Journals in other languages and lesser ranked journals, especially those based in developing countries, may be important sources too. Practical implications: More research on a broader range of accounting issues, especially in smaller and poorer developing countries, is needed. Although quantitative work is valuable, more recognition of the value of qualitative studies is needed, especially given the disappointing results of market-based policies prescribed by foreign institutions and their shift to advocating good governance reforms and achieving SDGs. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the most exhaustive analysis of recent accounting research on developing countries. It traces which journals have published such research, when, on which countries, on what topics and by whom. This is of interest to journal editors, course designers and researchers in the area. The authors hope that making the raw data and detailed analyses available online, consistent with protocols adopted in science disciplines, will encourage accounting researchers to do likewise to enable further testing of results and claims and build knowledge cumulatively. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Authors; Citations; Developing countries; Impact; Journal ratings; Topics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118163050

The main purpose of the research is to analyse the production of capia pepper economically in the light of agricultural business science. The original data used in the research were obtained by applying a questionnaire from 76 agricultural enterprises determined by the ""stratified sampling method"". According to the results of the research, the average age of business owners is 43.57 years, and the household size is 3.72 people in the enterprises examined. The professional experience of the producers in capia pepper production was found to be 17.78 years. Capia pepper production activity ranks first with a share of 34% in the herbal production pattern and 47% in the vegetable production value of the enterprises examined. It has been determined that the average capia pepper production area per farm was 15.48 da, and the yield was 3094.57 kg da-1 . In order to reach the average yield in one decare area in capia pepper production; 4454 seedlings, 44.51 kg of pure fertilizer, 485 ml of agricultural pesticides, 3.26 hours of machine pulling power, 19 lt of diesel fuel and 100 hours of manpower are needed. In order to gain an income of 2936₺ capia pepper from unit area in enterprises in terms of monetary size; seedlings worth 1943₺, pure fertilizers worth 253₺, agricultural pesticides worth 105₺, machine drawing power worth 382₺, diesel fuel worth 2312₺ and human labour worth 1387₺ are needed. The average sales price of capia pepper was determined as 0.99₺ kg-1 in the enterprises surveyed, and the highest average sales price was found as 1.19₺ kg-1 in the enterprises in the second group. Considering the average of enterprises; capia pepper production cost in per area was calculated as 5399.95₺ da-1, production value as 3063.62₺ da-1 and gross profit as-1934.92₺ da-1 . The results obtained in the research showed that capia pepper production in the research area was not profitable in 2020. Likewise, the sale price of capia pepper in 2020 was at the lowest level of recent years, and this had a negative impact on the product income. In order for the capia pepper production to be profitable in the examined enterprises, it is of great significance that the agricultural unions or cooperatives establish cold storage in the region and that the producer unions or cooperatives should make their presence felt during the marketing phase of the product. To create such a structure is seen as a significant phenomenon that can ensure price stability in the product. © 2022, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

This paper aims to propose a robust credit scoring system by leveraging latent information embedded in the telecom subscriber relation network based on multi-source data sources, including telecom inner data, online app usage, and offline consumption footprint. Design/methodology/approach: Rooting from network science, the relation network model and singular value decomposition are integrated to infer different subscriber subgroups. Employing the results of network inference, the paper proposed a network-aware credit scoring system to predict the continuous credit scores by implementing several state-of-art techniques, i.e. multivariate linear regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, multilayer perceptron, and a deep learning algorithm. The authors use a data set consisting of 926 users of a Chinese major telecom operator within one month of 2018 to verify the proposed approach. Findings: The distribution of telecom subscriber relation network follows a power-law function instead of the Gaussian function previously thought. This network-aware inference divides the subscriber population into a connected subgroup and a discrete subgroup. Besides, the findings demonstrate that the network-aware decision support system achieves better and more accurate prediction performance. In particular, the results show that our approach considering stochastic equivalence reveals that the forecasting error of the connected-subgroup model is significantly reduced by 7.89–25.64% as compared to the benchmark. Deep learning performs the best which might indicate that a non-linear relationship exists between telecom subscribers' credit scores and their multi-channel behaviours. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the existing literature on business intelligence analytics and continuous credit scoring by incorporating latent information of the relation network and external information from multi-source data (e.g. online app usage and offline consumption footprint). Also, the authors have proposed a power-law distribution-based network-aware decision support system to reinforce the prediction performance of individual telecom subscribers' credit scoring for the telecom marketing domain. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Credit scoring; Deep learning; Machine learning; Power-law distribution; Relation network; Stochastic equivalence",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116457264

Innovative sociotechnical design artifacts involve digital information technologies (IT) being used in ways that result in profound disruptions to traditional ways of doing business and to widespread societal changes. The pervasiveness of DI means that the individuals involved in bringing it about have diverse backgrounds, including application specialists, software engineers, data scientists, business managers, economists, venture capitalists, various user groups, and entrepreneurial leaders. This range of backgrounds means that DI, much more than traditional innovation, leads to varied perspectives on the methods and tools to be used in the development of effective and evolvable complex systems incorporating digital innovations. In this paper we present a new matrix approach to DI based on DSR, entrepreneurship, and innovation theories. Clear strategic guidance allows these multiple stakeholders to make sense of the diverse landscape and to understand when and how different entrepreneurial strategies for innovation can best be applied. We define the combined DSR and DI matrix approach in terms of four strategies: invention; advancement; exaptation; and exploitation and their associated DI practices. The research contribution is a novel DSR-DI matrix process model. This model extends entrepreneurship theory as it enriches effectuation thinking with more detailed process guidance for ambidextrous entrepreneurship and it enriches DSR models for DI by showing more explicitly the different pathways corresponding to different quadrants in the knowledge-innovation matrix. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Design science research; Digital innovation; Entrepreneurship; Entrepreneurship strategies; Information technology; Knowledge; Sociotechnical systems","Application programs; Design; Design science researches (DSR); Design-science researches; Digital information technologies; Digital innovations; Knowledge innovation; Multiple stakeholders; Socio-technical designs; Venture capitalists; Matrix algebra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089144433

The artifact is built in detail through epistemological rigor derived from empirical evidence and best practices related to the topic of understanding business processes, both based on well-established literature on the subject. Design/methodology/approach: In the case of research involving the construction of an artifact, the design science research (DSR) methodology was used to conduct engineering with an emphasis on the scientific method; for evaluation, the authors used the case study methodology. Data collection is based on documentation analysis, questionnaire, interview and observation. The authors also use references associating DSR with case studies, for greater contextual rigor of the research. Findings: This work presents findings and contributions, both new and also reinforcing others already present (1) use of the principles of Citizen/Plain Language improve instructional communication related to process modeling; (2) the citizen process language GERAL itself; (3) the BPMN pra GERAL guide for process translation; (4) qualitative findings from the observation of the use of the artifact in a real case, with non-experts and (5) a well-founded instance of building a notation with an emphasis on understanding, which can be replicated in other cases. Research limitations/implications: Future perspectives for conducting the research are presented. As a qualitative research instantiated involving a subjective construct, such as understanding, generalization is partially limited and should be interpreted as a transferability criterion. The evaluation involved participants with complete higher education and graduates, even though from areas not dedicated to process modeling or BPMN, being non-experts. The main indicator was understood with limitations in other aspects, such as formal semantics and precise executability. Practical implications: The formative research showed improvements to the base artifact, the framework first version, which will consequently be reflected in the guide. The GERAL and the guide were very well received, and all participants were able to translate the proposed model effectively, despite small slips in second notation. The guide improved the participants' perception of transparency and understanding of business processes, making them aware of the benefits of this topic. Social implications: The output of the built and researched artifact are understandable models by non-experts in technical languages of business processes. It is an alternative for BPMN models and dubious/long texts. Almost unexpectedly, the guide and its principles awaken an appreciation of understandable procedural communication, that is, it builds an intrinsic motivation in the user of the importance of publicizing his processes and assists in compliance with current data disclosure laws. It also builds informational democratic values of better participation and data absorption, from translators to the target audience. Originality/value: It presents a qualitative approach to deal with business process modeling and understanding; substantiates in detail, using well-established bases in the literature, the construction of a solution aimed at understanding business processes; offers a translation guide for non-experts and experts interested in disclosing and instructing their procedural information modeled in BPMN. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","BPMN; Business process modeling; Business process translation; Citizen language; Process understandability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126251475

The paper also assesses the extent to which the proposed mediation is moderated by senior management support (SMS). Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on the sociotechnical system theory to carry out a survey study of 278 functional managers from various manufacturing firms in India through a postal mail survey approach. The response rate has been improved by frequent telephone follow-ups. The collected data was analyzed for mediation of LDO and moderated mediation of SMS in the proposed framework using Hayes's PROCESS Macro in statistical package for social sciences. Findings: The research findings show that both PQM and LDO lead to better performance and should be encouraged. LDO was found to partially mediate the effect of PQM on the firm's OP. The results also show that an enhanced learning capability of an organization can significantly influence improvement in OP through a stronger support of senior management. Research limitations/implications: The current study explored the mediating role of LDO in the relationship between PQM and OP, while providing a future research opportunity for an empirical review of the mediating effect of LDO between the effects of just-in-time, maintenance and process benchmarking activities on OP. Practical implications: To transform PQM activities into a competitive advantage, firms need to develop learning capabilities. Senior managers in the manufacturing industry should strongly focus upon creating a learning-centered work culture to improve performance and productivity. Originality/value: The study provides insights into the type of people-related activities that manufacturing firms should undertake to enhance their OP.

The shift from in-person to virtual meetings has multiple consequences, some of which impact recordkeeping. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on research from records management, anthropology, organizational theory and computer science, this study establishes the norms of physical meeting spaces and recordkeeping and explores how these norms are challenged as meetings become virtual. Findings: Virtual meetings allow for collaboration to work across time and space and offer multiple affordances that do not exist in on-site meetings; however, they also involve the additional barrier of technical access and reduction in user attention. Virtual meetings also enable the creation, capture and sharing of increased contextual data, and this increased documentation challenges traditional recordkeeping models. Meeting technologies are also worryingly invasive. This study shows that concerns over privacy have been dismissed in the design of virtual meeting spaces, and therefore the authors recommend their more thorough consideration. Originality/value: Meetings are a pervasive feature of organizational life whose significance has been overlooked in the recordkeeping literature. By bringing together research about in-person and virtual meetings in a novel and necessary way, the authors started to fill a gap and hope to inspire further studies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Collaboration; Meeting technologies; Meeting technology; Meetings; Privacy; Recordkeeping; Teleconferencing; Virtual meetings",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122159117

However, extant literature primarily focuses on the organizational level phenomena, and has almost ignored the employee/individual perspective. This study thereby intends to capture the experiences of mid-level managers about these disruptions vis a vis their corresponding actions. Design/methodology/approach: In a small-sample qualitative research design, Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was adopted to capture this individual-level phenomenon. Twelve mid-level managers from large-scale Indian organizations that have extensively adopted data science tools and techniques participated in a semi-structured and in-depth interview process. Findings: Our findings unfolded several perspectives gained from their experiences, leading thereby to two emergent person-job (mis)fit process models. (1) Managers, who perceived demands-abilities misfit (D-A misfit) as a growth-alignment opportunity vis a vis their corresponding actions, which effectively trapped them into a vicious cycle; and (2) the managers, who considered D-A misfit as a psychological strain vis a vis their corresponding actions, which engaged them into a benevolent cycle. Research limitations/implications: The present paper has major theoretical and managerial implications in the field of human resource management and business analytics. Practical implications: The findings advise managers that the focus should be on developing an organizational learning eco-system, which would enable mid-level managers to gain their confidence and control over their job and work environment in the context of data science disruptions. Importantly, organizations should facilitate integrated workplace learning (both formal and informal) with an appropriate ecosystem to help mid-level managers to adapt to the data-science disruptions. Originality/value: The present study offers two emergent cyclic models to the existing person–job fit literature in the context of data science disruptions. A scant attention of the earlier researchers on how individual employees actually experience disruption, and the corresponding IPA method used in the present study may add significant value to the extant literature. Further, it opens a timely and relevant future research avenues in the context of data science disruptions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Data science and analytics disruptions; Demands-abilities (mis)fit and supplies-values (mis)fit; Formal and informal workplace learning; Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA); Organizational support and personal learning orientations; Psychological strain",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095612202

This is due to the fact that a roadmap itself reflects only a snapshot of an organization's strategic plan based on the information at the point when a roadmap is developed. It is crucial for an organization to monitor changes in its business environment which may exert different effects on a roadmap and assess whether such changes are sufficiently relevant and significant. If so, then an updated version of a roadmap will be required. According to current practice, the roadmap meeting is scheduled periodically to review and keep the roadmap it up-to-date. However, this approach may not be sufficiently proactive in monitoring the status of a roadmap and allowing the management to make a timely decision on its revision. This article explores the conceptual approach called data-driven roadmapping using a data-driven computerized decision support system that can be semiautomated to reflect any changes in the business environment, providing recommendations as to whether a roadmap needs to be slightly adjusted, totally revised, or remain unchanged. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Data science; data-driven roadmapping (DDRM); decision science; roadmapping monitoring; technology roadmapping; TRM; TRM implementation; TRM status signal","Artificial intelligence; Data driven; Data-driven roadmapping; Decision science; Roadmapping; Roadmapping monitoring; Status signal; Technology roadmapping; TRM; TRM implementation; TRM status signal; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118404823

Second, we offer R, SAS, and SPSS programs to conduct parallel analysis in factor analysis. Third, we incorporate inferential statistics, enabling hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. Finally, we discuss how parallel analysis can help scholars in ongoing debates about individual differences scales, construct and measure dimensionality, and the utility of multi-item scales.

The MBA is a unique program where students who have done courses such as business, engineering, medicine, science, arts, etc., can enrol.

Research for this paper, which is the first of its kind, compares both academic and job-performance as well as SES (socioeconomic status) of five types of MBAian. The aim here is to contribute to the literature on “human capital theory” by balancing “dynamic capabilities”. Adopting a “descriptive analysis” to both secondary and primary data, this study asserts that the MBAians who originally were from the science stream at secondary level did better in the MBA compared to graduates who learnt business at secondary school. Of five job competencies, the MBAian from science stream performed well in three while their counterparts who studied business education in the first degree did well in two. The MBAian from science stream come from a privileged socioeconomic background and their academic results from the secondary provision are better compared to the other four groups. Graduates with relevant prior business education backgrounds did not perform well in MBA programs. A good SES and earlier academic results helped the MBAian to succeed. This indicates that business education has no effect in mitigating the role of SES.

Less is known about the innovation effects of universities of applied sciences (UASs)—bachelor-granting three-year colleges teaching and conducting applied research. Furthermore, the evidence for positive innovation effects is predominantly based on average effects, while heterogeneity in innovation effects due to the economic environment is far less considered. By exploiting a public policy development in Switzerland that led to the quasi-random establishment of UASs, we investigate the regional heterogeneity in innovation effects of these UASs. We rely on patent and business census data and analyze the influence and importance of three economic preconditions—labor market size, labor market density and high tech intensity—on innovation effects of UASs. Our results show that only regions with a large or a dense enough labor market or with an above average high tech intensity experience significant innovation effects of UASs. Comparing the relative importance of the three economic preconditions, we find that labor market size is the most important factor that drives heterogeneity in innovation effects of UASs. © 2021, The Author(s).","Higher education research institutions; Innovation; Public R&D; Regional heterogeneity","Commerce; Digital storage; Employment; Population statistics; Public policy; Applied research; Applied science; Economic environment; Economics of science; Innovation activity; Labor markets; Policy development; Regional economy; Patents and inventions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100542085

The model was found to be both a valid and practical way to determine the state of an organization’s information and knowledge management and identify development needs. Research limitations/implications: Testing was conducted in the Finnish public sector and further studies applying the model could be implemented in other countries. The model presented was designed specifically for the public sector and more research is needed to test its applicability in the private sector. Originality/value: Maturity models are useful when evaluating information and knowledge management status in an organization, and beneficial for improving organizational performance. The proposed maturity model combines the fields of knowledge management and information management and contributes to the literature with an overarching maturity model that includes a dimension of satisfaction with the organizational maturity level. While many earlier models originate from the consultancy business, the model presented here was also designed for research purposes and tested in practice. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Information management; Knowledge management; Maturity model; Performance; Public sector","Design science; Design/methodology/approach; In-depth analysis; Information and knowledge managements; Knowledge management practices; Literature reviews; Maturity model; Performance; Public sector; Trend analysis; Knowledge organization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123056300

They share responsibilities to equip students with knowledge and skills. This study aims to examine and investigate the impact of knowledge sharing enablers (KSE) on knowledge sharing behavior (KSB). The paper measured KSE through perceived instructor support of knowledge sharing instructor support (IS), perceived information and communication technology (ICT) support of knowledge sharing and perceived ability to share knowledge (ASK). Design/methodology/approach: A survey questionnaire was used as an instrument for data collection. A sample of 597 students from Al Ain University in UAE participated in the study. The collected data were treated and analyzed through MS Excel and International Business Machines Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25. The theory of reasoned action (TRA) was used in formulating a conceptual framework. Several statistical techniques, including partial least square structural equation modeling, were used to test and verify hypotheses. Findings: Findings of the study supported TRA theory by suggesting a positive and significant impact of KSE (IS, ICT and ASK) on KSB. The findings supported the stated three hypotheses and confirmed that at least 45% of the variation in students’ KSB is explained by a variation in one of the three KSE indicators. The paper provided important theoretical and practical implications for researchers and managers of academic institutions. Originality/value: Academic institutions need to advance their strategies to create more collaborative environments for boosting knowledge sharing among students. Such practice will contribute in improving the students’ overall capabilities, skills and success of academic institutions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic institutions; Al Ain University; Knowledge sharing behavior; Knowledge sharing enablers; The theory of reasoned action; United Arab Emirates","Economic and social effects; Students; Surveys; Academic institutions; Al ain university; Information and Communication Technologies; Knowledge sharing behavior; Knowledge sharing enabler; Knowledge-sharing; The theory of reasoned action; United Arab Emirates; Knowledge management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123048638

By the end of 2021, 72.9% of global e-commerce sales will be generated via m-commerce and that by 2023 m-commerce will increase by 250% from 1.9 trillion US dollars in 2018 to 4.3 trillion US dollars. In light of these considerations, it is not surprising that, in the last two decades, research on m-commerce and the factors that determine its use has increased considerably Objectives: The work aims to provide a systematization of research on the topic of mobile commerce through a bibliometric analysis of the literature on m-commerce from a consumer behavior perspective in order to identify the most studied and emerging strands, which may represent future areas of research as well as useful directions for manufacturers and retailers that intend to develop m-commerce and omnichannel management strategies. Methodology: The work is based on a bibliometric analysis of the literature on mobile commerce from a consumer behavior perspective analyzing the contributions published from January 2000 to July 2020. The research was carried out following two phases: identifying contributions through the online database Web of Science (WoS) and bibliometric analysis through SciMAT. Findings: The results of a bibliometric analysis conducted on the research contributions of the last 20 years provide a clear picture of future research directions and the areas on which companies will have to focus in the development of omnichannel business models. Through the WoS database, 275 articles were collected, then analyzed with SciMAT in the two time periods 2000–2015 and 2016–2020. In the first period, contributions focused on identifying the antecedents of mobile commerce adoption and its relationships with trust, loyalty and customer satisfaction and its repeated use. In the second period, the focus was on interaction with other channels, with a multichannel and omnichannel perspective. Research limits: Although WoS is considered the most suitable data source for most publications, some contributions included in other databases may have been overlooked. In addition, the research does not take into account the contributions of the whole of 2020, which was most impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Practical implications: From a research perspective, it is possible to draw up the evolutionary picture of the topic, identifying the most covered and emerging strands representing valid opportunities for future research. From a managerial perspective, the research systematizes the results of existing studies by providing useful indications on mobile commerce strategies in retailing. Originality of the paper: With reference to the wide literature on mobile commerce, the research provides a first systematization of the contributions developed in the last 20 years and provides interesting insights for future research and managerial practices. © 2022 Research Results in Biomedicine.

Despite an abundance of approaches, BPI as a creative task is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Most importantly, its level of computational support is low. The few computational BPI approaches hardly leverage the opportunities brought about by computational creativity, neglect process data, and rely on rather rigid improvement patterns. Given the increasing amount of process data in the form of event logs and the uptake of generative machine learning for automating creative tasks in various domains, there is huge potential for BPI. Hence, following the design science research paradigm, we specified, implemented, and evaluated ProcessGAN, a novel computational BPI approach based on generative adversarial networks that supports the creation of BPI ideas. Our evaluation shows that ProcessGAN improves the creativity of process designers, particularly the originality of BPI ideas, and shapes up useful in real-world settings. Moreover, ProcessGAN is the first approach to combine BPI and computational creativity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Business process improvement; Business process redesign; Generative adversarial networks; Generative machine learning; Process mining","Design; Enterprise resource management; Process design; Business Process; Business process improvement; Business process redesign; Computational creativities; Creatives; Generative machine learning; Machine-learning; Organisational; Process data; Process mining; Generative adversarial networks",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140050237

Research purpose: This study investigated what practices BRPs apply in order to achieve management and financial control. Motivation of the study: Business rescue practitioners are faced with complex assignments with no clear measurements in practice, thus making judgements subject to the perception of the enquirer. It was important to better understand the practices applied by BRPs to achieve management and financial control. Research design, approach and method: A qualitative study was conducted and 13 BRPs within the Gauteng Province were approached. These BRPs were registered with the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission and consisted of junior, senior and experience BRPs. A thematic analysis was conducted to analyse the interview data. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Economics and Management Sciences at the University of Pretoria. Main findings: The findings indicate that management control is pursued via four main categories of tasks: meeting with stakeholders; clarification of roles; taking control of decision-making and understanding the business model. Taking financial control consists of managing finances, examining key financial information and engaging with financial people. Practical/managerial implications: For practitioners and educators, this study highlights the importance of using these practices to take control and remain in control in conjunction with management to achieve a productive rescue outcome. Contribution/value-add: This study minimises the gap that exists in the literature, detailing the specific activities conducted to achieve management and financial control and how to remain in control. © 2022.

Improving predictive accuracy is therefore extremely valuable. Data science researchers design algorithms, models, and approaches to improve prediction. Prediction is also improved with larger and richer data. Beyond improving algorithms and data, platforms can stealthily achieve better prediction accuracy by pushing users’ behaviors towards their predicted values, using behavior modification techniques, thereby demonstrating more certain predictions. Such apparent “improved” prediction can result from employing reinforcement learning algorithms that combine prediction and behavior modification. This strategy is absent from the machine learning and statistics literature. Investigating its properties requires integrating causal with predictive notation. To this end, we incorporate Pearl's causal do(.) operator into the predictive vocabulary. We then decompose the expected prediction error given behavior modification and identify the components impacting predictive power. Our derivation elucidates implications of such behavior modification to data scientists, platforms, their customers, and the humans whose behavior is manipulated. Behavior modification can make users’ behavior more predictable and even more homogeneous; yet this apparent predictability might not generalize when business customers use predictions in practice. Outcomes pushed towards their predictions can be at odds with customers’ intentions, and harmful to manipulated users. © 2022 International Institute of Forecasters","Behavior modification; Behavioral big data; Causal intervention; Internet platforms; Machine learning; Prediction error; Reinforcement learning",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139728594

Many researches on OR have been reported to supermarkets operations in the world. These include supermarket customer behaviours, productivity modelling, store simulations, promotion planning, and others. However, not much is known about the use of specific features that inform the optimality requirements of supermarkets in East Africa. It is important to find out specific consumer behaviours and cultural factors that may influence better performances on supermarkets and the extent of their considerations when planning business models. This may help to explain some of the factors of supermarket business failures in the region.

Natural language processing (NLP) is a technology that interfaces with different fields such as computer science, linguistics, and human-computer interactions. Over the past few years, there is a growing number of firms, which are using different BDA and NLP applications in their businesses. Only a few of the research have investigated different dimensions of NLP and BDA and their impacts on the overall organizational performance. There is a growing interest among researchers and practitioners in understanding the consequences for firms that adopt BDA and NLP applications. In this context, the aim of this article is to determine the factors for the usage of BDA and NLP applications in business. With the help of dynamic capability view theory and existing literature, a theoretical model was developed conceptually. Later, the model was validated using structural equation modeling approach considering 1287 samples from 23 firms, primarily based in Asia and Europe, which use NLP and BDA applications. The article finds that NLP and BDA applications help the firms to improve their operational efficiency, which in turn improves the overall firm performance.

Strategic buckets and adequate prioritization tools need to be crafted by the business environment. The literature on R&D portfolio management has evolved in the last decades, but still, it does not tackle some specificities of innovation dynamics in Complex Product Systems (CoPS). The research objective is to develop a project classification system for R&D portfolio management in CoPS, using Oil and Gas projects as case studies. The research method uses Design Science Research applied in projects from an R&D portfolio of a Brazilian Oil and Gas owner. The proposed method combined elements from the diamond model to innovation, product and technology development management tools, and strategic systems development, emphasizing the appropriate balance between technology-push and demand-pull in CoPS innovation dynamics. The method comprises a unique set of strategic buckets, a customized version of the diamond model considering uncertainties for CoPS and commercial development for Oil and Gas, and a set of evaluation tools recommended for each strategic bucket. The research contributes to CoPS R&D portfolio management, especially in the Oil and Gas sector. © 2022 PICMET.",,"Competition; Financial data processing; Gas industry; Gases; Sustainable development; Classification system; Complex product systems; Diamond model; Innovation dynamics; Oil and gas; Oil and Gas Sector; Portfolio managements; Project classification; System development; Technology development projects; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139092517

Process mining bridges the gap between process management and data science by discovering process models using event logs derived from real-world data. Besides mandatory event attributes like case identifier, activity, and timestamp, additional event attributes can be present, such as human resources, costs, and laboratory values. These event attributes can be modified by multiple events in a trace, which can be classified as so-called dynamic event attributes. So far, the process behaviour of event attributes is described in the form of read/write operations or object-lifecycle states. However, the actual value behaviour has not been considered yet. This paper introduces an approach that allows to automatically detect changes in the actual values of dynamic event attributes, enabling to identify changes between process activities representing events with the same activity name. This can help to confirm expected behaviour of dynamic event attributes, but also allows deriving novel insights by identifying unexpected changes. We applied the proposed technique on the MIMIC-IV real-world data set on hospitalizations in the US and evaluated the results together with a medical expert.

Since 1998, the European Journal of Innovation Management (EJIM) has been a leading forum dedicated to thought leadership and research on the advances in innovation management. Given that EJIM has run over two decades, the time is now opportune to reflect on the journal's contributions to innovation management. Thus, this paper aims to retrospectively review the productivity, impact and knowledge of innovation management research in EJIM. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts a bibliometric methodology to engage in a retrospective review of EJIM. The bibliographic data of 757 papers published in EJIM from 1998 to 2021 were retrieved from Scopus and analyzed using performance analysis and science mapping techniques. Findings: The productivity (publication) and impact (citation) of innovation management research curated by EJIM have grown prolifically over time. Though EJIM operates with a European title, the journal receives and publishes contributions worldwide (e.g. Asia, Europe, North America, South America and Oceania). Noteworthily, the knowledge of innovation management research in EJIM can be divided into four categories: basic themes (general), which comprise innovation, open innovation, new product development and product and process innovation; motor themes (well-developed), which consist of organizational culture and innovation and leadership and creativity; niche themes (very specialized), which include dynamic capabilities and business model innovation; and emerging or declining themes (weakly developed or marginalized), which is made up of research and development (R&D) and green innovation.

This research is applied in terms of its objective and mixed (quantitative-qualitative) in terms of its approach. The statistical population of the qualitative part of the research consists of experts who are fully acquainted with the subject of content marketing, including 17 professors in the departments of information science and knowledge, business management with the marketing orientation, information technology (IT), computer engineering and content production experts have chosen using purposeful and snowball sampling method. The statistical population of the research in the quantitative stage includes all managers, staff, and, librarians of Iranian public libraries, i.e. 7000 people. Using Cochran's formula and by stratified random sampling method, 364 people are selected as the total sample size. Due to sampling error (0.05) and the possibility of non-return of some questionnaires, 375 questionnaires are distributed and 366 questionnaires are collected and analyzed. Data collection tools are semi-structured interviews in the qualitative part and researcher-made questionnaire in the quantitative part, which is designed based on the findings of the qualitative part of the research. Also, the standard Kamalian, Amini Lari and Moezzi (2009) questionnaire is used to assess ECRM. In this study, theme analysis is used to identify the factors affecting content marketing, the fuzzy Delphi technique is used to consolidate the opinions of experts, and confirmatory factor analysis is used to evaluate the validity and reliability of the questionnaires. Results: Based on the study of texts and exploratory interviews with experts, five dimensions of strategic planning, content supply, and production, content distribution and dissemination, content analysis, pricing, and sales are identified for content marketing. Among these, content supply and production factor with an impact factor of 0.931 has the most impact and is the priority. Factors of content distribution and dissemination with a coefficient of 0.917; content analysis with a coefficient of 0.894; strategic planning with a coefficient of 0.877; and pricing and sales with a coefficient of 0.642 are in the second to fifth priorities in terms of effectiveness, respectively. Also, the impact factor of content marketing on the effectiveness of ECRM is calculated to be 816%. Findings at the error level of 0.05 indicate that content marketing has a significant effect on the effectiveness of ECRM in IPLF. ECRM in IPLF can be explained by the content marketing model. In addition to producing useful content related to the needs and preferences of its audience, it creates a powerful tool to gain trust and change the audience's attitude towards the services provided. Moreover, by increasing the skills of staff and managers, IPLF has made more efforts to identify, attract and retain audiences, which in the long run will lead to customer satisfaction, increased revenue growth, and achievement of competitive advantage. © 2022,International Journal of Information Science and Management.

Although firms are carefully considering this transition, the implementation of cobots is often carried out without careful consideration of the motivation and behavior of the employees working in hybrid workplaces. In the scenario when employees do not understand their work with cobots, it is unlikely that value is brought to a firm in the dynamic business environment. Thus, this study has multiple objectives. The first was to investigate the role of negative and positive valence factors on the employees intention to work with cobots. The second objective was to examine the effects of the creativity dimensions of employees on their behavior toward cobots. We developed a model for a hybrid workplace based on the componential theory of individual creativity and valence theory, in which the behaviors of human workers are combined with the dimensions of the cobots. Data were collected from 596 working professionals from India, and the proposed model was tested using partial least squares. We confirmed most of the hypotheses about the creativity of employees in hybrid workplaces and the positive valence of cobots with our empirical analysis. Therefore, we proved that future human-cobot collaboration needs to be focused not only on the benefits that cobots bring but also on human aspects like skills and expertise. This article is a contribution to the body of knowledge on new-age technology adoption by shedding light on the human and cobot dimensions. The results of this article may serve as a foundation for future applications and research on hybrid work.

The birth of new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and cloud computing marks the beginning of the fourth industrial revolution. Various new industries are rapidly emerging as Information and Communication Technology (ICT), artificial intelligence, big data, and other new technologies such as the Internet of Things are combined. Fintech is a technology that is attracting attention as new technologies and the financial industry merge. Fintech was formed from the confluence of the financial industry and information and communication technology by governments from all over the world, as well as continual innovation. Fintech is an innovation in the financial industry that uses new technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and other modern science and technology achievements to reform financial products, business models, and business procedures. One of the most basic tasks in the financial business is payment service. The development and introduction of new technologies have changed the way individuals pay. One of the notable fields in payment service is face recognition payment which is being used in various fields due to its high accuracy and low invasiveness. Facial recognition payment is a technology that uses computer vision to mimic human vision, allowing computers to analyze images. It is a technology that implements identity authentication based on personal facial feature information. The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect relationship between facial recognition payment on usage intention. For basic statistical analysis of the questionnaire, SPSS 22.0, a statistical package, was used. For hypothesis testing, concentrated validity and discriminant validity were verified using the structural equation package Smart PLS 3.0. Information technology factors that determine face recognition payment were divided into system characteristics and user characteristics. A summary of the result of the study follows. First, the system characteristics of face recognition payment had a significant effect on user resistance.

From that assessment, business should have a better grasp of the effectiveness of their fintech IMC implementation through a great customer understanding. Having reviewed the major contents of previously published works globally, the authors form an analysis framework for regression and CB-SEM examinations. The regression model has come with the CE variable as the dependent one (trend in using Agribank eMobile Banking application), and other 5 groups of independent variables. The SEM model, on the other hand, has been formed with 7 unobservable latent variables and 35 indicators. The paper employs inductive reasoning. The major method conducted is the mixed one (qualitative research for preliminary study and quantitative research for formal data processing). The IMC campaigns of VNPAY have been approached through the use of Multivariate Regression analysis, along with CB-SEM analysis with the aids of JASP and Lavaan syntax. In general, the research has successfully found a connection between the trends of using an eBanking fintech software of Vietnamese customers and integrated marketing communication efforts of the application developer. In addition, the study also helps confirm the theory of Marketing through profoundly understanding customers to trigger their interests towards digital products in the financial-banking sector. Its practical contributions relate to better understanding the effectiveness of IMC tools for digital space, digital products, and digital services; clarifying the digital behavior of customers towards digital banking products; and providing good reference conclusions for digital banking application developers about the IMC operational development model.

We show how structural topical modeling identifies topical themes that improve contestant performance using forum message data during the competition period. Our topic modeling analysis identifies technological and business issues that emerge in recommendation system development. An econometric framework further investigates the link between topic distribution and performance. The multiperiod difference-in-differences estimator reports no significant statistical relation when linking all message communications to the performance. However, topic-dominant and topic-dispersed messages are both found to positively and significantly impact performance. Our result shows that structural topical modeling has an essential role to critically examine the most valuable message links to boost performance.

Therefore, it is necessary to define a roadmap and a vision that will determine the steps forward in this direction. In line with this, the purpose of this study is a comprehensive review of past and present studies in this field to identify future research guidelines and gaps related to the implementation of this concept. Design/methodology/approach: This study is a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer software for all documents published in the Scopus database in the field of DTS from 2011 (the emergence of Industry 4.0) to 2021. It should also be noted that the data for this study have been collected and analyzed in September 2021. Findings: The current study presents the basic bibliometric results for DTS, and it focuses on DTS performance analysis and its science mapping during the past 10 years. This study first shows the publication process, types and languages of published documents, and the most influential authors, institutions, sources and countries in terms of publishing documents and receiving citations in the field of DTS. Then, by using the VOSviewer software, it shows the bibliographic coupling of top authors, institutions, sources and countries. Finally, it reports the co-occurrence of authors’ frequently occurring keywords and the timeline of their publications. Originality/value: The study presents the results of the first attempt to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of DTS-related documents. Its contribution lies in the fact that it has categorized the most frequently co-occurring keywords into specific clusters so that researchers will know which keywords have co-occurred with each other the most. Also, the most influential keywords in each cluster in terms of having total link strength and the number of its co-occurrence with others were identified. Finally, it became clear that the process of publishing documents over time has been concentrated on topics such as acceptance of digital culture, strategic renewal and digital transformation of business models, as well as presentation of a research agenda on the applications and barriers of DTS in critical situations such as COVID-19, which leads researchers to some awareness and insights for conducting new research. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bibliometric analysis; Digital transformation strategy; Industry 4.0; Scientific mapping; Transformational technologies",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136468630

Organisations reinforce competitiveness and improve performance when business activities and information technology (IT) efforts are aligned. The credibility of the IT organisation is an important influence on alignment. This research guides managers and directs future research to improve IT credibility. Design/methodology/approach: Interviews with senior leaders about factors influencing IT credibility provided rich data for analyses. The dynamic complexity of creating a credible IT function to ensure alignment was captured using qualitative system dynamic diagrams. A causal loop diagram was constructed to identify feedback loops and leverage points. Findings: The analysis confirms the impact of three factors identified by prior research. It provides a new perspective on portfolio-level IT governance's contribution to establishing credibility. The value of using past failure to develop credibility through ownership and resolution emerged from the analysis. Practical implications: The results provide guidelines to improve the IT organisation's credibility to improve business and IT alignment. Leverage points to improve credibility are provided, and research into resolving past failure as a mechanism to success is suggested. Originality/value: While most of the extant literature focused on static alignment factors, causal loop diagrams provided insight into IT credibility's systemic nature. A new factor (resolving past failure), a new perspective (portfolio level governance), and confirmation of existing factors and identifying leverage points contribute to practice and science. © 2022 The Author(s).","business and IT alignment; business-IT alignment; causal loop diagram; dynamic complexity; IT credibility; IT investment; IT value; qualitative system dynamics; strategic alignment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135591587

Many research works published have ignored the critical parameters and dimensions of green supply-chain management (GSCM) and logistics performance as environmental protective practices in the construction industry. Therefore, there is a need to investigate how the construction sector should implement GSCM programmes and logistics performance as environmentally friendly practices in their business activities, which would be beneficial to all stakeholders. Objectives: The present study intends to fill this gap by analysing the impact of environmentally friendly practices, such as GSCM and logistics performance in the construction industry in southern Gauteng. This study considered regulatory pressure, green information systems, green packaging, reverse logistics and logistics performance as environmental protective practices. Method: This study adopted a quantitative approach to survey a sample of 440 suppliers and purchasers’ managers from construction companies in the southern Gauteng province. A judgemental or purposive sampling technique was applied to collect data from respondents. Data were analysed with the aid of Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS 27.0) and Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS 27.0). In addition, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were used to analyse the relationship between constructs and test the hypotheses. Results: This study revealed that regulatory pressure, green information systems, green packaging and reverse logistics significantly influence logistics performance of construction companies. Conclusion: Study demonstrated that through GSCM and logistics performance, construction companies can correlate their business activities and the environment effectively. © 2022.

In the first quarter of 2019, according to Statistics South Africa, the Gross Domestic Product deteriorated by 3.2%. Similarly, in KwaZulu-Natal, the state of sustainability of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) was on the decline and the majority (75%) of SMEs failed after operating for 3 years. Research purpose: To formulate a business strategy to assist SMEs achieve sustainability. Motivation for the study: Small and medium enterprises in KwaZulu-Natal do not sustain themselves for long-term periods, the underlying problem being poor strategy formulation and hence, the need for a strategy to achieve sustainability. Research design, approach and method: A mixed methodology approach was used in this empirical study. A target population of 488 000 SME’s were considered with a sample size of 384 expected respondents. A total of 200 responses(> 52% of the target sample size) were obtained from the questionnaire within a capped period of 30 days. The Social Package for Social Sciences software was used for the quantitative aspect. In particular cross tabulations, central tendencies, and group difference techniques were used to analyse the data. In addition, the grounded theory was employed on a target of 20 individuals who were interviewed to investigate opinions towards strategy development and sustainability in KZN and NVivo software was used for the qualitative aspect. Main findings: The core element of ‘Strategy’ and the sub-elements of ‘Change’, ‘Purpose’ and ‘Leadership’ were investigated. It was found that ‘Change’, ‘Purpose’ and ‘Leadership’ were the main contributors towards achieving sustainability. Furthermore, a systems thinking model was used successfully to indicate the interdependencies to purport the goal of achieving sustainability. Ultimately it was found that ‘Strategy’, ‘Change’, ‘Purpose’ and ‘Leadership’ were required to achieve a ‘sustainable business strategy’. Practical/managerial implications: Due cognisance should be taken by leaders, from the perspectives of ‘Change’, ‘Purpose’ and ‘Leadership’, to formulate a strategy that sustains the business. Contribution/value-add: A conceptual framework to achieve a sustainable business strategy was developed for small to medium enterprises. © 2022.

SMEs are the backbone of many economies, representing 95% of all companies worldwide and accounting for 60% of employment. Based on this fact, this paper analyzes the influence of religiosity, knowledge and attitude to predict the intentions of SMEs’ owners in waqf participation in Malaysia and Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: Data were randomly obtained from 175 SMEs owners from Malaysia and Indonesia with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) used for analysis. Findings: The empirical analysis data suggest that knowledge and attitude show a significant impact on the intentions of SMEs’ owners to participate in waqf, while religiosity does not have a significant impact on the intentions of Malaysian and Indonesian SMEs’ owners to participate in waqf. Practical implications: This study aims to assist SMEs in Malaysia and Indonesia to formulate appropriate strategies and marketing using waqf for the sustainability of SMEs which represent more than 90% of business establishments in both countries. The strategy is a necessity, especially because the government is targeting to promote a sustainable Islamic financial system, improve governance policy and halal industry for SMEs, strengthen the development of Malay Reserve land, providing as financial independence to higher learning institutions and invest in digitalization and advanced technology through waqf funds. Therefore, both countries should take the initiative to provide training to equip SMEs with extensive knowledge through multiple platforms to further encourage their participation in waqf. Originality/value: Because of the increasing interest in waqf participation both in Malaysia and Indonesia, this study claims three essential contributions. First, it aims to examine the intention of SMEs in waqf participation among the business owners in Malaysia and Indonesia. Second, the study findings are expected to benefit the development of literature in accordance with Islamic social finance, particularly waqf. Third, this study provides an insight into the inclusive knowledge and attitude of SME owners and their intention to participate in waqf. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Indonesia; Intention; Malaysia; Small–medium enterprises; Waqf",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134199339

The longitudinal study would enrich the understanding of the research. Secondly, the study was focussed on the perspective of the dynamic capability view. Further studies can adopt a multi-method approach to develop a theoretical framework using in-depth study and empirical validation. It will help in a better understanding of the current situation and young discipline in SC. Thirdly, the study has considered only Kerala construction companies; hence, the data were less. More data with better results will be obtained if the study has included construction companies from other states. Fourthly, the study can be extended to understand the interdependent effects of SC agility, SC resilience and information technology capability on performance. Presently, the interdependent effect in the study is limited. Practical implications: The study helps the construction professionals to understand the preventive measures needed for the industry during any uncertainty. Also, the study is expected to help the construction managers and leaders with better performance in SCM and other business activities by adopting IT connectivity and being agile in all situations. Moreover, the study also helps policymakers take active solutions by providing awareness and incentives to the construction industry professionals. The literature and the factors will also help the academicians in further research progress. Originality/value: The research is important for construction professionals to comprehend the impact of COVID-19 and to analyse the influence of factors such as SC agility, SC resilience and IT capabilities on improving the SC performance. This research can assist private and public construction firms to enhance SC performance during times of uncertainty. The result is likely to help construction companies with better SC performance and helps academicians' further progress in research. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construction supply chain; COVID-19; Information technology capability; Resilience; Supply chain performance; Supply chain agility; Uncertainty",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134067051

In recent years, the study of organisational behaviour has been a topic of interest in the economic and administrative sciences. Due to the importance of studying the elements that makeup employee behaviour, the objective was to analyse the influence of the dimensions that make up perceived justice, such as distributive justice, procedural justice and interactional justice, on job satisfaction and turnover intention. The data obtained from five hundred fifty-five workers in Mexico's food industry were analysed using the structural equation technique by CB-SEM. The results suggest a correlation between all the variables in the study. In this respect, it should be noted that there are positive relationships among distributive, interactional, job satisfaction and distributive justices on turnover intention. The results suggest the importance of considering business practices that enrich the feelings of justice among employees to avoid developing negative feelings towards the company that may result in job abandonment. © 2022, Czestochowa University of Technology.

It is applied on entities that may exit from the market in Jordan. An electronic questionnaire (online questionnaire) was prepared, established and developed for this purpose and published via Google Form by using the simple random sampling method. A few months later, 399 fully answered electronic questionnaires were received, and the extracted data was analyzed by the Statistical Program for Social Sciences (SPSS), and a number of statistical tests were achieved, namely: the study tool's reliability, structural validity, the test for normal distribution, the Multicollinearity test, the description of the study sample characteristics, and the descriptive statistics for the study tool items. Each of the tests showed positive indicators. The decision making base that states: (If Sig.T > 5% Accept Ho and If Sig.T ≤ 5% Accept Ha) was used, and it was noted from the statistical analysis that: The Sig.T of the first sub hypothesis equals to (0.000). The matter that confirms the acceptance of the alternative hypothesis; (accurate assessment of liquidity risks ‘Assets Risks’, variable had the greatest impact on enhancing the entity's ability to withstand the COVID-19 pandemic). The Sig.T of the third sub hypothesis appoints to (0.000). This proves the acceptance of the alternative hypothesis; (the policy of deconcentration ‘business diversification’, variable came in the second place of effect on enhancing the entity's ability to withstand the COVID-19 pandemic). The Sig.T of the second sub hypothesis equalizes (0.031). This states the acceptance of the alternative hypothesis; (the impact of the accurate assessment of liquidity risks ‘financing risks’ variable came at the third place of effect on enhancing the entity's ability to withstand the COVID-19 pandemic). So, the null state (Ho), of each sub-hypothesis was rejected.

The profitability of a financial institution is dependent on how well the credit business is yielding revenue, hence there is a huge focus on optimizing this process and an ardent desire to reduce the risk of loan defaulters. Adoption of AI/ML technologies are transforming credit process by significantly reducing the risk by predicting loan defaults. Data Science has paved the way for enabling predictive analytics. Several data science techniques such as Logistic regression, SVM, Neural Networks, Random Forest are discussed in this paper on how they enable increasing the accuracy of predicting loan defaulters. This paper deals with how a credit score is predicted to help financial institutions set the terms of loan disbursements to their customers. The focus of this paper is to present a loan prediction solution-Seven Seas to financial institutions. Several aspects of loan origination have been dealt with in this paper. A high-level process of loan application and an alternative credit scoring model using Machine Learning has been described.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors utilized the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) technique for searching the articles published in Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus, to identify the main drivers and barriers affecting the tourist behavior during/post-COVID-19 pandemic. Eventually, 47 articles were chosen for the final analysis. Findings: The findings are reported in three sections, (1) quantitative research profile, (2) qualitative synthesis and (3) future agenda. This study addresses the nuanced questions regarding the significant change in tourist travel behavior, emotional dynamics and a detailed understanding of mechanisms, such as which drivers and barriers affect tourist behavior in a particular destination. Drivers and barriers to tourist travel behavior were characterized in personal-related, destination-related, and health-related factors. Moreover, this study provides thought-provoking ideas in theory, policy and practice in the field of tourism and hospitality. Research limitations/implications: This study has three limitations, as follows. First, the authors searched only two databases, Scopus and Web of Science, due to which the authors might be missing some related studies existing on the other databases. Although these databases provide an extensive range of academic literature, further studies could extend the data collection from the other databases (e.g. via Taylor & Francis). However, our systematic literature review (SLR) coverage is quite extensive, since journals are listed on these three main databases. Second, the authors followed a main study search protocol based on the synonyms and related keywords, however, some of the studies that may be related to the tourist behavior towards the destination are missing on account of the lack of our keywords in there, title, author, keyword and abstract. Furthermore, future research could endeavor to add other keywords to expand the results of studies. Third, although the accurate analysis was conducted to reduce subjectivity in identifying themes for drivers and barriers of tourist behavior, future studies on categorization could work to ensure that other sub-themes categorize. Practical implications: The recent study has some key practical implications. First, this study is valuable for all the stakeholders in a unique way, including destination managers, academicians and policymakers, because it provides insight into barriers and drivers that influence the development of tourist behavior towards the destination. Second, the current study also offers practical implications for people involved in tourism service industries including governments and private businesses. Policymakers and other leaders are increasingly interested in harnessing the economic potential of tourism. Therefore, identifying the barrier which is inhibiting the tourist traffic towards the destination is beneficial to understand and effectively develop strategies to minimize the effect of such factors. Moreover, drivers and barriers of tourist behavior towards the destination in the COVID-19 pandemic situation towards the destination may help to create a framework for the development of destinations according to the current vulnerable situation. Third, current findings suggest that tourism marketers understand the drivers and barrier constructs found in this study and tailor their marketing strategies for attracting existing and new tourists. For instance, marketers should understand the drivers and barriers of tourist behavior for effective strategy development to increase the positive effect of drivers and to reduce the negative effect of barriers. Originality/value: This is the first systematic literature review on the impact of drivers and barriers of tourist travel behavior. This paper analyses the methods and approaches that have been used in the previous literature to examine the drivers and barriers of tourist travel behavior. The paper ends with the research implication and limitations of the studies. © 2022, Naveed Ahmad, Amran Harun, Hafiz Muhammad Usman Khizar, Junaid Khalid and Shumaila Khan.","Attitude; COVID-19; Hospitality; Intention; Norms; Revisit intention; Systematic literature review (SLR); Tourist behavior",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133454490

This paper explores the rich potential of metaphors, root metaphors, and metaphorical thinking and reasoning as an overarching methodology for developing marketing theory. In this context, we first review the three major theories of metaphor origins – the comparison theory, the semantic interaction-tension theory, and the cognitive theory – for developing metaphoric thinking and reasoning in marketing. The comparison theory focuses on metaphors being a matter of words, as a deviant from normal literal usage, and is based on the similarities between two things. However, it has been argued that this theory ignores the crucial role of differences. This gave rise to the semantic interaction-tension theory, which introduced the notion of tension to describe the literal incompatibility relationship between the subject and that which embellishes it. While the semantic interaction-tension theory was an improvement over the comparison theory, it did not solve the issue of transition from literal incongruence to metaphorical congruence between two semantic fields. Thus, the cognitive theory argued that metaphor usage is not only emotive, but a cognitively potential vehicle of knowledge possessing special meaning other than the literal meaning and reading of text. In sum, a metaphor should not only encourage a premature analytical closure (and thus knowledge dissemination) by emphasizing similarity, but also work on tension that dissimilarities create for knowledge generation. Next, in our search for a suitable root metaphor for use in marketing, we formulate several research propositions to illustrate the sub-metaphor producer-consumer relationship under the root metaphor of the Free Enterprise Capital System. Finally, along each of the three theories of metaphor origins we extract layers of metaphorical utterances that we label as zero-order data sentences, first-order theory sentences, and second-order value sentences that indicate higher layers of conceptual and theoretical richness in marketing science. We discuss managerial implications, limitations, and new directions for research. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Metaphorical thinking; Metaphors; Producer-consumer relationships; Root-metaphors",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133316222

Design/methodology/approach: The study conveniently sampled 247 employees from the hospitality industry in Zimbabwe. Data were collected using a self-administered structured questionnaire with the aid of trained research assistants. Descriptive and inferential statistics were generated using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23. Regression analysis was used. Findings: The findings of this study indicate that the predictor variable (inclusive leadership) directly affects the outcome variable (employee engagement) in the presence of the mediator. In addition, these findings depict that the indirect coefficient was partially significant, which shows that psychological safety partially affects employee engagement in the presence of inclusive leadership. Research limitations/implications: The study came up with essential conclusions on the link between inclusive leadership and employee engagement in the hospitality industry. However, there is a need to exercise caution when generalising the findings to a different setting. The results represent the opinions of a sample drawn from Zimbabwe, a developing country in Southern Africa. Future research can carry out a comparative study on the same variables in the context of developed and developing countries. Further, future research can execute a longitudinal analysis to better understand if inclusive leadership directly affects employee engagement in the presence of psychological safety. This would help hospitality management to employ relevant leadership strategies that enhance employee engagement. Practical implications: This research has pertinent implications for both academics and human resource practitioners. The study results revealed that there is a direct effect on inclusive leadership and employee engagement. Practically, if leaders avail themselves to work with employees and discuss business operations and social issues affecting them, employees will be committed to exerting more energy towards their work and productivity will be improved. Moreover, it is understandable that mistakes always happen, but errors will be minimised and controlled in such an environment. The results also revealed that the connection between inclusive leadership on employee engagement is partly enhanced by the moderator. This may be taken as a good strategy that can be employed by human resources practitioners in the hospitality industry. Originality/value: The study significantly contributes to researchers and practitioners because it develops strategies for enhancing employee engagement in the hospitality sector. In addition, there is scant research that explores the mediating relationship of psychological safety between inclusive leadership and employee engagement in developing countries, particularly in the hospitality sector. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Employee engagement; Hospitality industry; Inclusive leadership; Psychological safety",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132665423

Theoretical framework: The agribusiness sector has the challenge of producing food sustainably to ensure food security for the planet's population by 2050. In this context, there is an exponential growth in investments in agriculture technology (Kakani et al., 2020). Most of these technologies are developed and marketed by AgTechs, the technological startups in agribusiness. AgTechs are expressive in the 4.0 agriculture scenario, where more precise and environmentally sustainable technologies are sought (Dutia, 2014. However, despite the growing number of AgTechs, few studies present their main concepts in the scientific literature. Design/methodology/approach: The Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases were used together with softwares: SciMAT and VOSviewer to develop the bibliometric study. The SciMAT was used to clean up raw bibliographic data, analyze, and configure the analysis. The maps generated were produced at VOSviewer and based on co-citation for the periods defined in the SciMAT. Findings: The results showed that the theme is not well consolidated in the literature, but it is in a dizzying growth, with 71.3% of the articles having been published in the last three years in 79 journals and with publications covering 44 countries. Research, Practical & Social implications: the AgTech theme is consolidating in literature where digital and disruptive technologies are concerned, however, the human factors, business models, and management aspects involved in this topic are being neglected, which resulted in the proposal of a Research Agenda that can help both academics and practitioners to analyze AgTechs aspects that appear to not be in focus right now.

METHODOLOGY: A systematic literature review (SLR) was undertaken using the Web of Science and Scopus databases. We limited our search to the last five years to identify the newest research publications, and we used keywords related to quantitative research while excluding qualitative research. Then we analyzed papers related to SEM and those published in English. FINDINGS: Our results confirmed that quantitative methods are used both in management and economics research, and showed a growing trend in the number of publications in the last five years. However, there are many more publications on management than on economics as well as there are more papers published in the Scopus database than Web of Science. Taking into account structural equation modeling, this method is used primarily in management research. In terms of industry, publications using SEM considered both single-and multi-industry including, first, all Asian countries and then African ones. Publications, especially in the management field, are descriptive in nature and based on primary data collected using a survey questionnaire. Papers are published in various journals and the most cited are those published in journals with wider subject areas. IMPLICATIONS: The systematic literature review is a fundamental necessity in any field of knowledge, benefiting both academia and learners. Our results may be useful for future researchers planning research using quantitative methods, especially SEM, in the business or economic field, by indicating the most cited papers and journals as well as industry and country areas. ORIGINALITY AND VALUE: This paper represents a systematic attempt to link quantitative methods, with a particular emphasis on SEM, with research interests on managerial and economic subjects and papers published in the Web of Science and Scopus databases. Employing the bibliometric analysis within the systematic literature review, the paper shows interest and the current state of research using quantitative methods which proves its value and originality. © 2022, Cognitione Foundation for the Dissemination of Knowledge and Science.

A thematic analysis using Atlas.ti software was also conducted to identify the main themes emerging from the literature related to roles and implications of marketing communication in retail. A total of 186 publications were identified from the period 1994–2021, and by applying threshold criteria for the bibliometric analysis, we identified 54 documents based on their citations and link strengths. The most influential authors, articles, journals, countries and keywords were determined. In addition, content analysis of the publications resulting from the paper analysis was carried out, with the identification of four main clusters that summarize the most important themes addressing the main roles and implications of marketing communications in retail across these themes: (i) sustainability, experiential consumption and consumer trust; (ii) misalignment in the push-pull relationship of marketing and sales and multichannel dynamics across the purchase funnel; (iii) integrated marketing communication as practice and marketing communication forms in value creation and co-creation; and (iv) interactive technologies and marketing appeals in brand considerations. This analysis provided a basis for the organization of marketing communication roles and implications related to retail research and brings practical implications for retail businesses when engaging on integrated marketing communication planning.

This is due in part to its origins. Much of the uniqueness of the anthropological worldview is both a cause and a consequence of the process of gathering data in unfamiliar settings. Early twentieth century anthropologists were charged with recording the world’s cultures at a time when little was known about many of these ways of life. Thus, ethnographic techniques based in interviewing and observation were devised to cope with the field setting where every pattern was hidden and every experience unfamiliar. While anthropologists use quantitative methods, this unique, early research setting shapes the ways they approach research and develop theory. The strength of using ethnographic techniques in a familiar setting, such as a business in one’s own culture, is that it challenges one’s assumptions. By guiding the anthropologist to learn cultural patterns anew, the techniques help him delve below the obvious familiarities. In the study of a business problem, anthropologists gather data by (1) looking at the larger, holistic context, (2) interviewing individuals from all relevant stakeholder groups in order to understand the interconnectedness of stakeholder issues, (3) viewing the worker on the shop floor as just as much an expert on the workings of the organization as the CEO, and (4) understanding that, while data gathered quantitatively is significant, it is thin in providing understanding when not accompanied by the rich, contextual data accumulated in time spent with the stakeholders. Thus, from the perspective of business, the anthropological approach is one that “humanizes” business. From an anthropological perspective, it is one that provides useful insight into the workings of any human grouping. This article will describe the anthropological approach, provide examples of its use in business, and discuss current trends in anthropological research in business. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ethnographic techniques; Holism; Sociocultural anthropology; Stakeholder issues",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131830873

Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a case study research design that made use of predominantly qualitative research methods. Data was collected at three study sites, namely, Mzuzu University, Malawi University of Science and Technology and the Malawi University of Business and Applied Sciences. A purposive sample of three officers per institution (and nine in total) comprising executive officers, deputy university registrar, records clerk, information and communication technology (ICT) directors and ICT manager was attained. The researcher personally conducted the interviews with the research subjects with the aid of interview guides. Observations were also done, whose findings were recorded in the observation protocols. The data collected was transcribed in MS Word, coded and analysed thematically. Findings: This study concluded that e-records are at high risk in public universities in Malawi. Irrespective of this situation, this study found that there were some areas for e-records to potentially thrive in public universities in Malawi. Research limitations/implications: This study covers three of the six public universities in Malawi. Although public universities in Malawi have similar governance structures, there are some noticeable differences that distinguish one institution from the other. It is, therefore, possible that findings made in this study may not completely represent the prevailing situation in all public universities. Originality/value: Studies of this nature have not been done before in public universities in Malawi. It is, therefore, hoped that besides filling the existing knowledge gap, its findings will contribute to policy and practical interventions that will lead to efficiency of the universities involved. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","E-records management; E-records management tools; Malawi; Public awareness; Public universities; Records policies; Training",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131789520

In this article, we focus on using data and data analytics in product-oriented industrial companies. Although data-driven services are becoming increasingly important, little is known about their systematic design and development in research. Surprisingly, many companies face significant challenges and fail to create these services successfully. Against this background, this article presents findings from a multicase based on qualitative interviews and workshops with experts from different industrial sectors. We propose ten design principles and corresponding design features to successfully design industrial data-driven services in this context. These design principles help practitioners and researchers to understand the peculiarities of creating data-driven services more in-depth on a conceptual, technical, and organizational level.

Commonly, the event data is recorded by information systems referring to business events and typically tracked at a higher activity abstraction. Disciplines like economics, engineering, life and natural sciences could gain high benefits from process mining in terms of identifying anomalies in the process or supporting predictive analytic in what is being measured. In this way, process mining based analysis give more insights into data than traditional approaches do setting the focus on data correlations. However, these domains mainly rely on sensor data producing time series information, where the event data does not directly relate to high-level business process concepts. This paper suggests an approach for process discovery on “raw” time series data by leveraging clustering to raise the abstraction level of events. As a use-case, we applied our approach on ocean science data where we used raw sensed time-series data from a simulated seasonal coastal upwelling system. In this way, we can give new insights into the data in terms of the identification of anomalies in the process flow aiming to prevent unintended consequences. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","Clustering; DTW; Process mining; Time series","Abstracting; Time series; Clusterings; Descriptive Model; DTW; Economic engineering; High activity; Process mining; Process-based; Time-series data; Times series; Traditional approaches; Data mining",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131334306

Nevertheless, already since the 1990s and early 2000s, IT has had a huge impact on the digitalization and digitization of businesses. This phenomenon of advancing in digital-oriented work practices is not only affecting the customer side, but is also changing the way of working within organizations. Although employees are one of the crucial elements in each organization and their level of work satisfaction is critical to the efficiency of a business, their work impression is still undergoing scrutiny when it gets to digital process innovations. Moreover, organizations still benefit from assistance in their adoption of digital-oriented work practices, for which a related maturity model (MM) can be one of the solutions. The current Ph.D. plan consists of three research projects that follow a mixed-method approach with a combination of quantitative and qualitative designs, within an overall design of Design-Science Research (DSR). Project 1 has two subprojects (i.e., a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and a data-driven analysis). It starts with analyzing the relevant literature from a people–process–technology (PPT) perspective to extract relevant factors when digitalizing business processes. Afterwards, it investigates a representative set of European employee data using statistical data analysis (e.g., factor analysis and ANOVA) and data mining (e.g., clustering) techniques to delve into the impact of digital-oriented work practices on work satisfaction. After this artefact identification, we continue with Project 2 (i.e., expert panel, case study) to add evidence for a maturity-based gradation along with the identified clusters of digital-oriented work practices. Finally, Project 3 helps concretize the intended MM by focusing on the relationships with employee satisfaction and the relevant factors. Our findings will assist organizations to upgrade their work practices (i.e., including assessment and improvement advice), while simultaneously empowering their employees. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Maturity model; People-process-technology; Work satisfaction","Data mining; Digital economy; Digitisation; Emerging technologies; Maturity model; Modeling approach; People-process-technology; Process Technologies; Roadmap; Work practices; Work satisfactions; Personnel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130923116

The healthcare industry produces large volumes of data, and challenges in cost and patient outcomes are increasing. In order to provide health services in the fastest, most accurate, and highest quality way while also meeting the needs of both patients and healthcare organizations, healthcare professionals must reach the most accurate and up-to-date information and utilize this information by using computerized support systems. For this reason, it is inevitable for healthcare systems to become a structure supported by artificial intelligence that both speeds up and facilitates the way of doing business and provides some basic information and services to patients without being too dependent on the system. Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can recursively improve itself based on the information it gathers. By increasing the availability of healthcare data and enabling rapid progress in analytical techniques, it brings paradigm changes to healthcare services. Artificial intelligence has been used or tested for a variety of health and research purposes, including management of chronic conditions, workload reduction of doctors and nurses, drug discovery, provision and prevention of health care, diagnosis, treatment of diseases, and patient monitoring. Artificial intelligence has the ability to transform medicine through the role of physicians and nurses and to transform medicine through new science research and delivery models that revolutionize medical practices and enhance person and public health outcomes. Today, artificial intelligence practices are carried out in many private and public health institutions in many countries. In this section, we will discuss in detail the application of artificial intelligence in the modern healthcare system with advantages and possible disadvantages and challenges. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Artificial intelligence; Clinical decision support system (CDSS); Deep learning; Electronic health records (EHRs); Healthcare industry; Healthcare system; Intelligent virtual agent (IVA); Machine learning; Optical character recognition (OCR); Robotic surgery",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130821036

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the Web of Science (WoS) Database to analyze the contribution in supply chain mitigation literature by authors, themes in supply chain mitigation and the citing articles. An investigation based on bibliometric approach for the SLR represents the bibliographic data of over 530 publications between the years 2020–2021. Additionally, the article also develops graphical visualizations of the bibliographic data analyzed using the R-program Bibliometrix to ascertain the top sources, authors, keywords and conceptual themes. Findings: Most strategies in the existing literature focused on reactive approaches to supply chain disruption and current mitigation literature has not evolved in parallel to the changing macro environment leaving a wide gap in considering vaccines as a supply chain mitigation strategy. Hence, this study identifies the potential need to focus on building proactive supply chain mitigation strategies preferably by studying the role of vaccines in mitigating supply chains. Practical implications: This article helps the reader to understand the scientific research in terms of contributions in supply chain mitigation research since pandemic. Though, the time frame considered limits the connection the findings to previous work on supply chain disruptions and mitigation, it offers an understanding of the various mitigation themes evolved in light of mitigating the supply chain disruptions as one caused by the current pandemic. Further, this research helps us understand how businesses can help reduce the social consequences by preventing the disruptions and helping life normalize during this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Over the years, new sources of finance have evolved to respond to this need and provide new options for entrepreneurs. Using a bibliometric analysis, this paper examines the evolution of the academic literature and analyses the relationship between entrepreneurship and alternative financing over three periods of time (1975-1999, 2000-2010, and 2011-2020). This work aims to provide a clearer view of the evolution of this relationship and identifies current trends and future lines of research. The data were obtained from the Web of Science (WOS) database and systematized using SciMAT software. Results show that venture capital and business angels have become the main financing sources for entrepreneurs, being the most studied from different approaches, especially since 2000. Incubators in universities and research centers, corporate governance, and development of this type of financing in emerging countries are emerging as potential areas for further research in this field. © This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Atribution 4.0 Internacional License","Alternative financing; Bibliometric analysis; Entrepreneurship; Venture capital",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130338568

The purpose of this research is to conduct a systematic mapping exercise on the available scientific literature related to FBDOs in hospitality in the DR and their link to reported food safety and hygienic practices. Design/methodology/approach: A predefined search protocol applied the principles of PRISMA guidance. Publications (n = 2,793) from databases (e.g. Web of Science, PubMed) were identified and systematically selected for relevance. A full-text assessment based on the inclusion criteria led to the identification of a refined list of studies and academic publications (n = 22) included in this review. The descriptive analysis of the collated data is then presented graphically. Findings: A low rate of reporting highlights a knowledge gap on FBDOs, the related food safety hazards and how they are mitigated by stakeholders and local health authorities in the DR. Improving government and other stakeholder capacity to report, investigate and understand FBDOs and the practices involved is essential. Research limitations/implications: The research has implications for Government, businesses and public health officials and managers in the hospitality sector in the DR. A potential research limitation is that the search strategies could miss some relevant articles. Practical implications: The findings provide a framing for improved risk analysis in implementing food safety management strategies for FBDOs. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first systematic mapping research assessing evidence of FBDOs affecting hospitality in the DR. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Dominican Republic; Foodborne disease outbreaks; Hospitality; Systematic mapping",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129619225

This study aims to evaluate the perception of tenants of TPs to determine the gap in the expectation and identify types of firms preferring to locate in a TP. Design/methodology/approach: This is the first study in Pakistan to collect data about perceived benefits of TPs in Pakistan from the decision-makers of 110 tenant firms. The cluster analysis and lift ratios are used to draw statistical inferences. Findings: The firms can be classified into three clusters – commercial-orientation firms, science and technology-oriented firms and young tech firms – with distinct needs for survival and growth in a TP. Moreover, TPs should not just be treated as property projects for providing support services, also knowledge sharing, training and development opportunities and proximity to hubs of knowledge and markets is vital to attract a variety of industry. Originality/value: Academia and policymakers have been equally interested in the potential impacts of these innovation hubs. However, there have been lack of empirical evidence on how and what to offer the incumbents of these TPs. The government of Pakistan is trying to build more TPs for promoting business activities under CPEC. Therefore, it is extremely important to determine the needs of tenants of TPs for successful utilization of huge amount of public money to be invested in TPs. © 2022, Sami Ullah, Abdul Sami, Tooba Ahmad and Tariq Mehmood.","Innovation; Knowledge sharing; Social and business networking; Technological development; Technology parks",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128996393

This paper highlights the strategies that tourism companies should implement in times of crisis to reduce the negative impact. It also discovers the business opportunities which can be offered amid this deadly pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on a systematic literature review. The literature has been explored by utilizing the keywords “economic crises,” “coronavirus,” “Indian tourism industry,” “Global tourism industry” on the three most popular databases namely Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar. In this study, statistics, current events, published research papers and a synthesis of news transmitted by various media sources were used to assess the economic crisis caused by coronavirus. Findings: The obtained findings demonstrate that coronavirus severely affected the economy of the world and India. The pandemic has hit the economies that are dependent on tourism the worst. These countries are expected to bear the brunt of the crisis's consequences for longer than other economies. This coronavirus outbreak indicates that the tourism industry was unprepared to deal with such a pandemic, which affected and crippled the economy. Research limitations/implications: This study demonstrates economic crisis, management strategies and business opportunities during any crisis, chaos and disaster, in addition to its academic contribution to the existing body of the literature. Policymakers and industry practitioners might be offered suggestions based on the findings of current study to design futuristic strategies for better economic crisis management. The data given in this study is timely because taking an exact idea of tourism losses through the data is difficult, as the data changes as quickly as the virus spreads. Originality/value: This paper forms its originality by concentrating on the aspects of economic crisis, strategies to mitigate the negative impact of coronavirus on the tourism economy and detailing the business opportunities which these crises can offer.

The methodology's schematic view comprises four steps: data collection, data analysis, data visualization and interpretation. The present study intends to understand GHRM scholarship using Bibliometric R-package and VOSviewer software. Findings: The study offers some interesting insights that may help scholars, line managers and top management to conceptualize the GHRM practices in their organization, which is currently limited to a few HR practices (hiring, training and reward), geographies, developed countries and industries. These can be extended to other HR practices (e.g. industrial relations). In addition, this paper contributes to the GHRM literature in identifying the keywords, authors, journals, intellectual, conceptual and social structure. Research limitations/implications: The study underpins the research in the area of GHRM in order to understand the trends on this topic over the past 17 years in terms of prolific authors, most impactful journals, key themes and the field's intellectual and social structure. The study indicates that this field is still in its development stage. Hence, there is a need for more arduous research on the topic to help develop a better understanding of this new field. Originality/value: The paper helps understand green practices in human resource functions, focusing on corporate sustainability goals. It helps the line managers and top management make GHRM a central function for achieving sustainability goals. In addition, these findings can be a road map for the researchers to investigate the field of GHRM further. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate sustainability; Environmental management; Environmental performance; GHRM; Organizational performance; Sustainability; Sustainable development",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127327218

The essence of this transformation is to change from the backward to the advanced, and one of the important indicators to measure the change is the standard. Therefore, the formulation and promotion of standardization are of vital importance to the economic development and the social stability. Enterprises are for-profit subjects, and the purpose of all their behaviors and strategies is to obtain economic benefits. Whether they can obtain benefits and how many benefits they can obtain is the key variable for enterprises to decide whether to participate in standard development. Previous relevant literatures have proved that the formulation and promotion of standardization are beneficial to the development of various industries and the society, but they mainly stay at the macro level, and provide little theoretical and empirical evidence for the viewpoint that enterprises who participate in standard development can generate benefits. Particularly in China where enterprises confront the problem to develop standards of different scales, natures, regions and types, it is even more complicated to identify whether enterprises can obtain benefits and how many benefits they can obtain. Therefore, this paper takes enterprises of the strategic emerging industries for example and adopts propensity score matching (PSM) method to empirically analyze the influence of whether enterprises participate in standard development on the revenues of enterprises. According to the classification of strategic emerging industries mentioned in Decision on Speeding up the Cultivation and Development of Strategic Emerging Industries by the State Council of China, this paper chooses six industries as the research objects, including the next-generation information technology industry, high-end equipment manufacturing industry, advanced nonferrous metal materials industry, advanced inorganic nonmetallic materials industry, new-energy automobile industry, and new energy industry; chooses the data about the drafting units of China National Standard, Industrial Standard and Local Standard as of 2018 from China Standards Online Service Network and Local Standards Information Service Platform, and the relevant data about the 2018 operations of listed companies in the abovementioned six industries for analysis. First, this paper takes whether enterprises participate in standard development as the category variable, the income from operation of enterprises as the target variable, and these factors, including capital input, labor input, government, innovation and controlling shareholders of enterprises as the control variable for the PSM matching analysis. This paper also classifies enterprises according to their scales, organization forms, regions, and the standards whose development enterprises participate in for the heterogeneity analysis which include three matching methods, such as nearest neighbor matching, radius matching and kernel matching. After PSM matching, the samples of the treatment group and the control group are successfully matched, and there are no significant difference between the models and the samples of the treatment group and the control group that control variables. The matching results show that the t value corresponding to the ATT value of different target variables in both the full sample and the classification matching has passed the significance test. When the ATT value is positive, it means that participation in standard development can improve the business performance of enterprises, and when the ATT value is negative, it means that participation in standard development can reduce the business performance of enterprises. More specifically, enterprises that participate in standard development can increase their gross profit. Large enterprises that participate in standard development can expand their scale and profit, while small enterprises that participate in standard development can expand their scale; non-state-owned enterprises that participate in standard development can exert positive and stable influence on their revenues, namely, scale and profit; enterprises in the eastern and central regions that participate in standard development can respectively increase their profit and sale; enterprises that participate in local standard development can beneficially improve their profit. From the above, this paper puts forward some policy suggestions to encourage enterprises to actively participate in standard development. Firstly, enterprises should actively and initiatively attach importance to participating in local standard development; non-state-owned enterprises and enterprises in the eastern and central regions should arouse the enthusiasm of enterprises to participate in standard development, especially local standard development, and meanwhile pay attention to discovering, cultivating and encouraging talents. Secondly, state and government should get a more in-depth understanding of standardization and issue policies to enhance the awareness of enterprises in the industry to improve the quantity and quality of standards. They should also highlight key points, optimize government-led standards and increase the participation of enterprises in local standard development. As well, they ought to strengthen financial and technical supports for enterprises to participate in standard development, and encourage non-state-owned enterprises and enterprises in the eastern and central regions to participate in standard development. © 2022,Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.All Rights Reserved","Psm matching; Standard development; Strategic emerging industries",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126937253

Therefore, building strategic alliances to obtain resources and create value is an important means to achieve the survival and development of new ventures. However, controversial views on performance of strategic alliances indicate that the effectiveness of strategic alliances is still not clear: some research suggests that the strategic alliances can realize “Borrowing-hen-lay”, namely with the help of partners and their resources advantage to build market trust and business reputation to optimize new product development, speed up the market, gain legitimacy, and overcome the market barriers. However, some other studies have found that the influence of alliance on performance may be negative, that is, the strategic alliances among new venture may “Bring-wolf-home” unfortunately. Through the lens of configuration theory, this paper explores the relationship between strategic alliances and entrepreneurial performance under the moderate effects of environmental factors to clarify the effect mechanism of strategic alliance for new ventures. The purpose of this study is to effectively respond to the “effects paradox” of strategic alliances from the perspective of strategy-environment fit, and to clarify whether the formation of strategic alliances by new ventures is contingent on the external environmental conditions. Empirical data were collected through questionnaire survey, and the measure of all variables were drawn or adapted from existing scales, and were revised through preliminary survey of sample data. The official survey for data collecting covered the new ventures that were incubating or had been incubated at 15 Mass Innovation Space in Chongqing and Chengdu authenticated by the ministry of science and technology of China. The survey lasted for two months, 300 questionnaires were issued and 247 were received, excluding the data of 36 firms that had participated in the preliminary survey. Finally, 211 valid questionnaires were collected, and the effective recovery rate was 70. 33%. Empirical results have proved that strategic alliances of new ventures have significant impact on entrepreneurial performance. This shows that regardless of the external environment, both technology alliance and marketing alliance positively affect entrepreneurial performance. Meanwhile, on the one hand, policy uncertainty has a positive moderating effect on the relationship between technology alliance and entrepreneurial performance, that is, the higher the policy uncertainty is, the more significant the influence of technology alliance is on entrepreneurial performance. The in-depth analysis of the difference between entrepreneurial performance shows that the moderate effects of policy uncertainty is mainly reflected in the positive impact of technology alliance on growth performance. On the other hand, competition intensity positively moderates the relationship between technical alliance and entrepreneurial performance, while negatively moderates the relationship between marketing alliance and entrepreneurial performance. When distinguishing growth performance from customer performance, it further shows that competitive intensity positively moderates the effect between technology alliance and growth performance while negatively moderates the effect between marketing alliance and growth performance as well as customer performance. Under the perspective of strategy-environment fit, this study unpacks the effect mechanism of strategic alliances of new ventures, and clarifies the environmental conditions for new ventures to make use of strategic alliances. The research attempts to integrate strategic management and entrepreneurship, which has certain theoretical value. At the same time, the conclusions provide several managerial implications for new ventures to better build strategic alliances by “Borrowing-hen-lay” while avoiding “Bring-wolf-home”. © 2022,Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.All Rights Reserved","Competitive intensity; Entrepreneurial performance; New ventures; Policy uncertainty; Strategic alliances",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126935731

We draw from family science and management research to suggest that family CEOs, because of their emotion-evoking double role as family members and business leaders, are, on average, more likely to infuse employees with positive emotions, such as enthusiasm and excitement, than hired professional CEOs. We suggest that these emotions spread through firms by way of emotional contagion during interactions with employees, thereby setting the organizational affective tone. In turn, we hypothesize that in firms with family CEOs the voluntary turnover rate is lower. In considering structural features as boundary conditions, we propose that family CEOs have stronger effects in smaller and centralized firms, and weaker effects in formalized firms. Multilevel data from 41,200 employees and 2246 direct reports of CEOs from 497 firms with and without family CEOs provide support for our model. This research suggests that firms managed by family CEOs, despite often being criticized as nepotistic relics of the past, tend to offer pleasant work environments. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",,"Business leaders; Centralised; Management research; Multilevel data; Organisational; Positive emotions; Science research; Structural feature; Turnover rate; Work environments; Human resource management",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126520212

The CSC concept has been discussed in the literature more than a decade. This study aims to find out the theoretical roots of CSC by analyzing scholarly articles in literature. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses document cocitation analysis for reaching this aim. After retrieving data from Web of Science database, this paper explores data set by considering used references of these publications and clusters them based on their title terms and visualizes them by using cosine similarity index. Findings: This paper concludes that CSC is mainly discussed along with sustainability, sustainable supply chains and green supply chains, where the focus is integrating circular economy principles to supply chain management (SCM). On the other hand, although resiliency is an essential characteristic of SCM, contribution of CSC to supply chain resilience is neglected in the literature. Research limitations/implications: CSC will gain importance in near future to increase national/firm productivity, and findings of this paper will give researchers insights for furthering their studies. Social implications: To avoid supply chain and market collapse caused by natural disruptions, supply chain resilience is of paramount importance. According to the findings of this paper, the authors believe that business resilience in COVID-19-restricted environment may have exit point by using circular perspective. Originality/value: The importance of CSC has increased due to the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this unique study was undertaken to investigate the evolution of this crucial topic with evidence from the literature through a cocitation analysis. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Circular economy; Circular supply chain; Cocitation analysis; Supply chain management; Sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125143967

Despite many bibliometric studies on the co-authorship in different scientific fields and worldwide countries/regions, Iranian researchers' collaboration in the management field has not been studied. This study aimed to investigate the co-authorship networks in the management papers contributed by Iranian researchers indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) during the recent half-century (years, 1969-2018). Bibliometric data on 5414 papers were extracted from WoS and analyzed in Excel, UCINET, and VOSviewer to measure bibliometric indicators, the map needed co-authorship networks, and depict time-based maps and keyword clustering. Findings showed that co-authored papers increased from two items in 1973 to 721 items in 2018. Expert Systems with Applications, African Journal of Business Management, and International Journal of Production Research were ranked first to third in co-authored papers. Top 20 authors published about 17% of papers (946). Islamic Azad University, University of Tehran, and the Amirkabir University of Technology ranked first to third. Most co-authorship frequencies were made from 2012 to 2014. The first to third ranks of collaborating countries were the USA, Canada, and England. Six main keyword clusters were formed, including main topics in the field. In conclusion, Iranian researchers increasingly co-authored in management, especially during the last decade, and published in various journals that some top ones are prestigious journals.

The focus is on firms located in the Eastern European countries that are seldom a subject of empirical innovation studies. The theoretical framework takes into account that moderate and modest innovator countries, which comprise the sample, have distinct innovation ecosystems relative to advanced economies. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses data from the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) that was conducted in 2013–2014 and covering the period of the past three years. Product innovation is measured through its intensity (a number of product innovation) and through its commercial success (innovative sales). A set of hypotheses are tested using a negative binomial estimator (for the number of product innovation) and a tobit estimator (for innovative sales) estimated in Stata statistical software. Findings: Empirical findings show that vertical cooperation has a positive effect on the intensity of innovation activities. In contrast, the authors find no evidence that horizontal cooperation or cooperation with science partners (universities and research centres) increase innovation intensity or its commercial success. Besides vertical cooperation, for a commercial success, it is equally beneficial for firms to use their own innovative ideas. These results taken together suggest that closed innovation and cooperation with customers and suppliers are critical determinants of product innovation in Eastern European firms.

The study emanated from observations that the widespread use of information technologies has created a new sector in the labor market - infopreneurship. The study adopted the case study research design based on focus group discussions to establish the students' attitudes towards infopreneurship. The participants for the focus groups were students of the Information Science department at the University of Technology, Cape Town. Data collection during the focus group discussions was based on unstructured interviews. Quantitative data analysis was applied based on data reduction from codes to categories. An enterprising attitude (26.4% code frequency) dominated the positive responses while negative attitudes were mainly reflected by a critical attitude (20.8% code frequency) towards infopreneurship. While it appeared that positive attitudes were more prevalent than negative attitudes, there were notable observations that the respondents were critical or neutral towards the essence of infopreneurship in the South African context. It was found that the belief that infopreneurship is not a viable form of employment was still prevalent. Some respondents believed that employment means working for someone. They felt that there is greater respect in being employed than engaging in infopreneurship. Some respondents, however, appear to have stronger entrepreneurial orientations and felt that infopreneurship offers the best employment opportunities. The study recommends changes in higher education curricula and the creation of a stimulating environment for infopreneurship. © Thobekani Lose, Sebenzile Khuzwayo, 2022","Attitudes; Entrepreneurship; Infopreneurship; Information; Small business; Technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124170777

Subsequently, the study attempts to know the struggles of SME during Covid-19 crisis in a developing country. Furthermore, the study provides a critical dynamic resilience strategy framework to manage the SMEs in the crisis period. The authors extracted data from Scopus and Web of science to conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), Extracted data from both databases were merged using R programming get the same tag in R programming. The study adopts a bibliometric analysis to present the research corpus in the domain of “Covid-19 and SMEs”. The cluster method of R programming has been used to usher the significantly affected areas of SMEs. Based on the cluster theme, an open-ended questionnaire was developed and used to interview 23 SMEs in Bangladesh for the case study. NVIVO-13.00 was used to extract the topic from the transcriptions of the interviews. The study reveals that Cash flow shortages and Supply Chain Disruptions are the critical constraints of SMEs. On the contrary, Digital transformation has gained momentum during this crisis. Enterprises that made the best use of digital platforms through technology, digital marketing, and innovations secured the peak of success and profitability. The study also recommends a critical dynamic, resilient strategy model to adopt in the ""new normal"" for successful navigation of SME business in the future. The study is the first of its kind that integrates SLR and a case study on the hurdles of SME owners during the Covid 19 crisis. Thus, it helps advance the understanding of the subject matter and enables the formulation of resilient strategies by policymakers and SME owners to navigate the business in any potential crisis in the future. The study has significant methodological contribution as it presents how to merge both Scopus and web of science data to conduct bibliometric analysis through R programming. Besides, it also contributes to using R's clustering method to extract themes for “SME and Covid -19” domain. Finally, the study presents an overview of SMEs in crisis such as Covid-19 and a case study of a rising economy and its response measures.

Determining an entire business electrical energy usage, inclusive of core operations and support activities, in a singular evaluation protocol is a challenge. The challenge is exasperated when changes occur in the business, where every change implies significant rework of the business energy calculations. This study develops a holistic energy determination model for the entire business requiring minimum inputs for energy re-calculation, when aspects of the business changes. Design/methodology/approach: The research adopts a quantitative approach enabled through a Discrete Event Model. The model is developed based on the activities performed in every functional area of the business. The activities are captured using business process science. The processes are then developed into a DES Model. The model development cycle includes data collection, model development and configuration, model validation and scenario models for optimization. Findings: A coal fired power generation business, with multiple sites is comprehensively simulated to evaluate the baseline electrical energy demand and associated CO2 emissions. The results are captured at various levels of the business including; Enterprise; site, business function and equipment level. The generation sites operational functions are identified as major electrical energy consumers. The adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies of Internet of Things, Big Data Analytics, mobility and automation demonstrate energy savings of 1% of total site demand. As the Industry 4.0 technologies are applied to a limited number of processes, the results demonstrate the capability of these technologies having a significant impact on electrical energy demand and CO2 emission when applied to a broader spectrum of business processes. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited to a multi-site energy generating company, which is a coal to energy business. Practical implications: The research has significant practical implications, mostly on the mechanisms to evaluate business energy utilisation. The ability to include all areas of the business is a key practical differentiator, as compared to traditional models focusing on operations only. Originality/value: The model is unique in that it is a model that is system agnostic to any production configuration, most especially changes in configuration. This implies that the model can be easily and quickly adapted with changes in the business. This implies the model proposed would be significantly more adaptable when compared to traditional approaches. © 2022, OmniaScience.

Because of widespread and rapid commercialisation and public and private sector market penetration of technological innovations, communications can now be virtually instant in both formal and informal terms and can result in the transfer of resources and in the making of contracts. There is and can be no effective check on network traffic other than that provided by computer algorithms which can generate calculations, data processing, and even automated reasoning based upon input data. The need for legislative, regulatory, and administrative protocols at levels wider than an individual nation state is a corollary to the global footprint of information and communications technology networks, with its all-pervasive impact on society worldwide. Advances in science now have an all-pervasive impact on the social, economic, political, and cultural organisation and governance structures of society at local, regional, national, trans- national, and global levels, and, indeed, on the life of each individual, of the family, and of every human grouping … small and large, private and public, voluntary and juridically structured, entrepreneurial and not-for-profit, informal and formal. Assimilation of scientific advances by society is, per force, contingent upon society’s capacity and willingness to embrace such an assimilation. Wolff succinctly articulated this point in his seminal philosophical work on ethics and public policy when he said that ‘Broadly, then, if large change is to take place, the world needs to be ready for it.’(J. Wolff, ‘Ethics and Public Policy: A Philosophical Inquiry’, Routledge, Oxford, 2011, p. 208). The practical realities of societal and technological developments for enterprises, product and service, private and public, can be judged from major international studies such as the 2019 PwC global survey of nearly 1400 CEOs which identified the top ten business risk factors, in order, as follows – over-regulation, policy uncertainty, availability of key skills, trade conflicts, cyber threats, geopolitical uncertainty, protectionism, populism, speed of technological change, and exchange rate volatility. The PwC survey was reported and analysed from a business viewpoint by Dan Holly and Sabine Vollmer in the professional accountancy journal Financial Management in May 2019 in the context that Brexit, trade wars, and political unrest are increasingly impacting negatively on global business (D. Holly and S. Vollmer, ‘Rise in geopolitical threats worries business leaders’, Financial Management, Journal of the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants, comprising the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) (UK), 16 May 2019, at https://www.fm-magazine.com/news/2019/may/geopolitical-threats-worry-business-leaders- 201920547.html accessed 27 February 2020). This Chapter scopes some of the parameters of societal organisation, scientific advances, including in information and communications technology, and spirituality. It concludes that the rapid advances in information and communications technology, with a global footprint, challenge the human capacity for adherence to moral principles in ethical policy decision- making, and require matching governance structures at global level. The issues discussed in this paper are, therefore, fundamental to the evolution and operational delivery of meaningful ethical public policy. © 2022, Springer Nature B.V.","Civil governance structures; Disconnect; Global networks; Ireland; Knowledge revolution; Public policy; Science; Social and economic relationships; Spirituality",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123614582

The research model was based on Technology Acceptance Model in which academic discipline (hard, pure, soft, applied) was involved as a moderator variable. Data were collected from 240 students using a questionnaire on which the partial least-squares structural equation modelling and the Henseler's multi-group analysis were used to compare differences among academic discipline-groups. In summary, results show that the degree of importance attached to perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and attitude toward video use when students explain the intensity of their instructional video usage differs between hard/soft, and pure/applied academic disciplines. In the case of hard-pure subjects (e.g. natural sciences) and hard-applied subjects (e.g. engineering or computer science) the intensity of video usage, as a learning resource, is mostly determined by the students' expectations in relation to the effortlessness (or otherwise) of learning with videos. In the case of soft-pure subjects (such as sociology) and soft-applied subjects (such as law and business studies) positive/negative feelings associated with video usage also play an important role in the intensity of video usage as a learning resource. The degree to which a student believes that using videos would enhance his or her learning has a stronger influence on the intensity of video usage in the case of soft-pure subjects than in the case of soft-applied subjects. © 2022 Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

However, extant works lack a discussion on the influence of distributed innovation on digital innovation performance. Drawing on the opportunity perspective, the study constructs a moderated mediating model to address how distributed innovation directly affects enterprises' digital innovation performance. Particularly, it investigates the moderating and mediating effects of IT-enabled capabilities and digital entrepreneurial opportunities on the above correlation. Design/methodology/approach: With a survey data set of 399 Chinese science and technology enterprises, the study conducts hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) and bootstrap to test the study’s hypotheses. Findings: Results demonstrate that (1) distributed innovation positively enhances enterprises' digital innovation performance; (2) digital entrepreneurial opportunities partially mediate the positive relationship between distributed innovation and digital innovation performance; (3) IT-enabled capabilities positively moderate the relationship between distributed innovation and digital entrepreneurial opportunities; (4) IT-enabled capabilities positively moderate the mediating role of digital entrepreneurial opportunities in the relationship between distributed innovation and digital innovation performance. Originality/value: This is an empirical study on the impact mechanism of IT-enabled capabilities and digital entrepreneurial opportunities on the relationship between distributed innovation and digital innovation performance in China.

In this regard, the study illustrates BC's products and services rendered to customers, forms of delivery channels and BC's view on banking services and Kiosk-based BC programs. Design/methodology/approach: The current paper is an empirical study based on surveying 200 Kiosk-based BCs working in the state of Kerala. After the preliminary screening analysis of the data with outlier deletion, removal of missing values and normality test, both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were executed followed by reliability test, convergent and discriminant validity tests. Covariance-based structural equation modeling (CBSEM) was performed for CFA and inferential tests were carried out by using statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) and analysis of a moment structures (AMOS) and Eviews. Findings: Chiefly, eight operational forms of BCs were found from the field survey. Hypothetical tests show the significant impact of the serviceability of banks on BC's profitability. Validity tests such as average variance extracted (AVE), composite reliability (CR), maximum shared variance (MSV) and average shared variance (ASV) were established after the removal of the cross-loaded items of the questionnaire from the rotated component matrix. BCs perform main banking services especially bank account opening facility and Akshaya E-Centers are widely used for this model as Kiosk banking in the surveyed state. Originality/value: So far, no study has encompassed empirical research on performance analysis and outreach of the BC model in the state of Kerala where this BC model well functions. Since the study is a novel form of banking channelization for FI, the study can contribute to understanding the further feasibility and future dimension of the model based on experimental views of BCs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business correspondent (BC) model; Financial inclusion; Kiosk banking; Structural equation modeling (SEM)",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122347260

However, higher rates of economic growth from this effect are not easily discerned from the long run data, and government and business financed R&D have moved in opposite directions (as a proportion of GDP) since the early 1960s in the US and elsewhere. This paper looks at potential sources of ‘crowding out’ as well as ‘crowding in,’ and compares standard analysis with a ‘contribution good’ model of science. Two different policy issues are identified – the assembly of ‘critical mass’ for the ‘kick starting’ of commercial science, and the expansion of commercial science beyond its ‘private equilibrium’. We analyse the allocation of scarce business as well as scientific skills between sectors. The model produces regions of both crowding in and out. The latter dominates for very high wages in the public sector as the government deprives the private sector of the means to exploit new knowledge. © 2021","Crowding out; Entrepreneurship; Science; Spillover; Tacit knowledge","Crowding out; Economic theories; Entrepreneurship; External benefits; Government supports; High rate; Private sectors; Science; Spillover; Tacit knowledge; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117684052

However, many industries cannot effectively incorporate data science into their business processes, as there is no comprehensive approach that allows strategic planning for organization-wide data science efforts and data assets. Accordingly, this study explores the Data Science Roadmapping (DSR) to guide organizations in aligning their business strategies with data-related, technological, and organizational resources. The proposed approach is built on the widely adopted technology roadmapping framework and customizes its context, architecture, and process by synthesizing data science, big data, and data-driven organization literature. Based on industry collaborations, the framework provides a hybrid and agile methodology comprising the recommended steps. We applied DSR with a research group with sector experience to create a comprehensive data science roadmap to validate and refine the framework. The results indicate that the framework facilitates DSR initiatives by creating a comprehensive roadmap capturing strategy, data, technology, and organizational perspectives. The contemporary literature illustrates prebuilt roadmaps to help businesses become data-driven. However, becoming data-driven also necessitates significant social change toward openness and trust. The DSR initiative can facilitate this social change by opening communication channels, aligning perspectives, and generating consensus among stakeholders. © 2021","Big data; Data science; Data-driven organization; Digital transformation; Technology management; Technology roadmapping","Big data; Competition; Metadata; Architectural frameworks; Competitive advantage; Data driven; Data-driven organization; Digital transformation; Roadmap; Roadmapping; Social changes; Technology managements; Technology roadmapping; Data Science; architecture; conceptual framework; data set; stakeholder; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116906475

This study quantita-tively analysed a substantial amount of statistical data regarding the R&D expenses of Japanese manufacturing industries to crosslink the study fields of diversification and R&D collaboration so as to fill the research gap in the preceding studies. The findings of the analysis were as follows: (1) the automobile and accessories manufacturing and pharmaceutical manufacturing industries have focused on their core business and actively collaborated with external parties to acquire fundamental technologies from outside; (2) the other seven major manufacturing industries exhibit high levels of R&D diversification but rel-atively low rates of external expenditure; (3) the science-based automobile and accessories manufacturing industry and pharmaceutical manufacturing industry have built up a long-term collaborative relationship with partner organisations through academic–industrial collaboration or the effective utilisation of R&D investment to encourage partner companies to acquire new technology from outside. This study successfully visual-ised the relationship between the 21 years of R&D diversification and R&D collaboration in nine major manufacturing industries in Japan.

A convenience sampling technique was applied to collect data from the respondents. Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (26.0). Moreover, confirmatory factors analysis was applied to examine and test the relationship between observed constructs and their casual latent construct. Smart PLS 3.0 was also used to test the hypothesised relationships between the constructs. The current study revealed that green image, environmental performance and customer requirements are determinants of competitive advantage. The results also showed that there is a negative relationship between green image and environment performance. The results of the study also revealed that, through green image, customer requirements and environmental performance sustainable competitive advantage can be achieved. © 2021 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd.

Purpose: This led to this paper seeking to understand the impact monetary access and monetary literacy have on the sustainability of SMEs in the COVID-19 era. Research methodology: The method was employed by this study is a quantitative research method, which is supported by a positivism research paradigm. Data was collected using a questionnaire completed by 310 sampled participants. Using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences to analyse data, descriptive, the Pearson correlation and regression analyses were used to estimate the model. Results: The Pearson correlation indicated a positive and significant correlation between monetary access and monetary literacy to the sustainability of small and medium-sized enterprises (r = 0.564). The result indicated that some small and medium-sized enterprises do possess basic monetary skills while some do not. A significant number of small and medium-sized enterprises do not understand basic monetary terms, which justifies the lack of monetary literacy. Novelty: The study recommends that government agencies that assist with business registration should include a monetary training course as part of registration formalities. Further to that, the study recommended that government, banks and other business support institutions should simplify support programmes for the prosperity of small and medium-sized enterprises during and post COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 Thabiso Sthembiso Msomi et al., published by Sciendo.","Monetary Access; monetary Literary; small and medium-sized enterprises; sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126608975

Since these studies focus on different topics periodically, we aimed to make a bibliometric analysis of the structural social capital literature that allows a regular, systematic, and quantitative evaluation of published articles in management and organization science to identify the underlying structure in this research area and to identify the main research themes of the scholarship. Methodology: The bibliographic matching technique was used for checking international databases to explore the main concepts and themes of the management and organization literature and to identify main themes in the research area. Therefore, this article offers a bibliometric analysis of the literature that allows for a regular, systematic, and quantitative evaluation of published articles to identify their underlying structure and to identify the main research themes in the scholarship. Research data were analyzed using the text mining method, which is a sub-branch of the data mining method and one of the most critical ways to analyze and process unstructured data. Findings: Structural social capital studies were examined in management and organization science databases in three periods forming four years. Although there are no completely different emerging themes, we noticed periodic differences and change in priority rankings. Moreover, we found that the subjects repeat every period with few new concepts. Implications: This research shows the main themes in the management and organization literature, where structural social capital elements are examined together, and covers all areas of management, organization and business science. Considering the main topics of the three periods of this research, there are similarities, namely the words that rank among the top in each period are ""innovation,""""entrepreneurship,""""knowledge management,""""performance,""""leadership,""""technology,""and ""human resources""and these themes are the most prominent. Originality/Value: This research presents an overview of all past studies that focus on the structural social capital present in social interactions. Since structural social capital influences management and organization literature, it is considered a valuable study and a guide for future research. © 2021 Hale Alan et al., published by Sciendo.","bibliometric; bibliometricstructural social capital; management; organization; structural social capital",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123992719

After manual computation, ancillary prices are filed in ATPCO (Airline Tariff Publishing Company) or Merchandising systems and these prices can be further tailored to the characteristics of the ancillary request through merchandising rules. Using airline ancillary and itinerary data, we built a gradient boosting machine algorithm that can understand the intricate relations between numerous attributes such as passenger type, itinerary, aircraft type, ancillary product, or season and can make an automated pricing decision based on science. The analysts are relieved from manual work and have the flexibility to change the machine learning (ML) algorithm’s input and output to suit business strategies. The ML algorithm learns the new trends and patterns as part of its training, and analysts can track its performance periodically. The output of the ML algorithm seamlessly integrates with merchandising platforms to implement the dynamic pricing of ancillaries and offers in the direct, indirect, and channels with new distribution capability. The ML algorithm is extendable to airline and third-party ancillary products and ticket bundles.

The data used in the analysis come from the first nationally representative survey of labor insertion of recent university graduates in Spain. By estimating a multinomial logistic regression, we are able to identify the match status 4 years after graduation based on self-assessments. We find a higher likelihood of horizontal mismatch among graduates of Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Pharmacy, and Languages and Literature. Only graduates in Medicine increase the probability of being adequately matched in their jobs. It may be hypothesized that horizontal mismatch is more likely among those graduates in degree fields that provide more general skills and less likely among those from degree fields providing more occupation-specific skills. Other degrees such as Business Studies, and Management and Economics Studies increase the probability of being vertically mismatched (over-educated). Vertical mismatch preserves at least some of the specific human capital gained through formal educational qualifications. However, some workers with degrees in Labor Relations and Social Work are in non-graduate positions and study areas unrelated to their studies. The paper also shows that graduates in the fields of health sciences and engineering/architecture increase the probability of achieving an education-job match after external job mobility. © 2021, The Author(s).","Education-job mismatch; Higher education; Horizontal mismatch; Job turnover; Multinomial logistic regression; Spanish university degrees",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105430615

While HEIs’ prominent role in promoting regional economic growth, innovation, and attractiveness receives considerable research attention, most of that attention is paid to aspects of HEIs that are directly related to STEM activity. There are various theories that suggest spillovers from non-STEM activity at HEIs as well, specifically in the arts. This study examines whether spillovers occur for HEIs’ large capital investments in the arts. Specifically, we focus on HEI investments in arts physical infrastructure and whether these investments have any effects on regional-level business activity, including jobs and firms. To analyze HEI spillovers of physical arts infrastructure on regional jobs and firms, we use construction starts data on building projects from Dodge Analytics, Inc. and data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, which include administrative data for every college, university, and technical/vocational institution that participates in the federal student financial aid programs. We couple these data with public data on regional-level socioeconomic indicators from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Zip-code Business Patterns data. We employ a quasi-experimental propensity-score matching design in order to control for a host of HEI and regional-level characteristics in examining the impact of infrastructure investments.

Findings: The findings show that managerial narcissism is positively and significantly associated with Iran’s financial statement comparability. In contrast, Iraqi data articulate a negative association between these two variables. This paper finds that Chief Executive Officer overconfidence and financial statements’ comparability are negatively related in both countries. Following the market variation, the different findings suggest that institutional settings such as the general managerial style, adopting international accounting standards (now IFRS) leading to the extent of auditing market globally in Iraq and suffering from international sanctions in Iran, the governing business environment may play an allocative role in preparing financial statements.

Instability in production and market risks make agriculture a risky business and directly affect farmers’ income levels, thereby impacting food security. This review aimed to understand various features of different crop insurance policies in India and to analyze the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana’s (PMFBY) impacts on Indian farmers. A literature search was performed in all popular databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, AGRICOLA, AGRIS, and Google search engines, as well as annual Indian government reports. The keywords “Crop Insurance” OR “Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana” OR “National Agriculture Schemes” AND “India” were searched to obtain relevant articles. By using cumulative data, we conducted a multiple regression analysis and a model was developed to estimate the effects of insurance characteristics on farmer coverage for the years 2017–2018 and 2018–2019. Agricultural insurance coverage under PMFBY remained low in terms of the number of farmers insured, the area insured, claims paid, and total farmers benefited. Compared to other schemes, the beneficiary and claim premium ratios were substantially lower under the PMFBY. The multiple regression analysis showed that farmers’ premiums have a significant effect on the number of farmers insured over time, although the subsidies do not have a significant influence in farmers’ insurance participation. Delays in claim settlement, the complexity of the system, and a lack of awareness among farmers are the major weaknesses of the PMFBY. Greater use of digital media could help spread awareness of these schemes among farmers. © 2021 by the authors.

Semi-structured in-depth interviews were initiated to generate data from three motor companies with purposively selected 30 participants. Findings revealed that auto employees who are not electrically inclined are self-encouraged to seek technical and electrical careers to secure a future in the automobile industry. These workers may also pursue careers in computer science. Many autoworkers have supplemented and stabilized their incomes through FOREX and Bitcoin mining trading. Simultaneously, these employees are receptive to changing careers in agriculture. Again, autoworkers prefer self-employment to the job insecurity associated with industrial positions. In general, motivation for upskilling for a future job in the automotive industry is low. Before the Covid-19 crisis, organizations were adopting new ways of doing business that tend to unready workers' readiness. This trend increased very steeply during the pandemic. Retraining and reskilling as steps for workers' readiness to face job automation are not outright answers that will lead to job security. Nonetheless, automobile workers have to treat their careers as businesses and invest in skills under the umbrella of non-automatable technical and non-technical job families. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Future of work; Job automation; Precarious work; Reskilling; Technological unemployment; Upskilling","Agricultural robots; Job satisfaction; Future of works; In-depth interviews; Job security; Labour force; Motor industry; Self employment; Semi-structured; South Africa; Automobiles; automation; automobile industry; future prospect; skilled labor; technological development; unemployment benefit; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113273688

Research on prescriptive analytics recommends uplift models to guide targeting decisions. Uplift models predict how much a marketing action will change customers' behavior, known as the individual treatment effect (ITE). Marketers can then solicit customers in decreasing order of their estimated ITE. We argue that the ITE-based targeting policy is not fully consistent with a business value maximization objective. We propose business-centric evaluation metrics that integrate estimates of the ITE and the expected business value and validate their benefits relative to the ITE-based targeting baseline using real-world marketing data. The new metrics yield remarkably higher profit across different uplift models, targeting depths, profit functions, and data sets. They further contribute to the growing field of interpretable data science by uncovering interdependencies between covariates, ITE, and profit and by clarifying whether customers are worth targeting because of high responsiveness or high value. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Evaluation metric; Interpretable data science; Target marketing; Uplift modeling","Data Science; Profitability; Sales; Business value; Business-centric; Covariates; Evaluation metrics; Profit function; Targeted marketing; Treatment effects; Value driven; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113171632

Customer churn prediction is a crucial tool to support customer retention. It allows an early identification of customers who are at risk to abandon the company and provides the ability to gain insights into why customers are at risk. Hence, customer churn prediction models should complement predictive performance with model insights. Inspired by their ability to reconcile strong predictive performance and interpretability, this study introduces rule ensembles and their extension, spline-rule ensembles, as a promising family of classification algorithms to the customer churn prediction domain. Spline-rule ensembles combine the flexibility of a tree-based ensemble classifier with the simplicity of regression analysis. They do, however, neglect the relatedness between potentially conflicting model components which can introduce unnecessary complexity in the models and compromises model interpretability. To tackle this issue, a novel algorithmic extension, spline-rule ensembles with sparse group lasso regularization (SRE-SGL) is proposed to enhance interpretability through structured regularization. Experiments on fourteen real-world customer churn data sets in different industries (i) demonstrate the superior predictive performance of spline-rule ensembles with sparse group lasso over a set well yet powerful benchmark methods in terms of AUC and top decile lift; (ii) show that spline-rule ensembles with sparse group lasso regularization significantly outperform conventional rule ensembles whilst performing at least as well as conventional spline-rule ensembles; and (iii) illustrate the interpretable nature of a spline-rule ensemble model and the advantage of structured regularization in SRE-SGL by means of a case study on customer churn prediction for a telecommunications company. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Customer churn prediction; Interpretable data science; Predictive analytics; Regularized regression; Sparse group lasso; Spline-rule ensemble","Benchmarking; Decision making; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Sales; Splines; Telecommunication industry; Classification algorithm; Customer churn data set; Customer churn prediction; Customer retention; Operational decision making; Predictive performance; Structured sparsities; Tree-based ensemble classifiers; Predictive analytics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101404963

Despite the importance of this knowledge field, and the significant quantity of research that has focussed on this theme, there is a dearth of studies in the literature undertaking a systematic SKM review. This study aims to provide a currently complete and systematic SKM review to stimulate and contribute to furthering this academic field and correspondingly set out an agenda for future research. Design/methodology/approach: This paper sourced the data from the science citation index expanded (SCI-expanded), the social sciences citation index (SSCI) and the arts and humanities citation index (A&H CI) databases. This research spanned references published in journals belonging to the categories of management, business and economics without any chronological filter. The search returned a total of 99 references with their dates of publication between 1995 (1 reference) and 2018 (7 references). Findings: The results included the identification of three core approaches to this study field: SKM models and competitive advantage, SKM implementation and the Systematic SKM approach. Practical implications: This current study seeks to undertake the mapping of the scientific publications, the intellectual structure and research trends in the SKM field to: identify the fundamental contributions to the SKM research field; determine the research pathways establishing its intellectual structure and the scientific journals with the greatest impact on the field and identify the SKM research field geographical distribution and its collaborative structure. Originality/value: This study defines a roadmap for an informed research agenda that proposes multiple directions: the usage and development of an innovative theory that may open new paths for future research and theoretical construction; a more sophisticated understanding of the concept and its applicability; approaching the shortcomings interrelated with the content across different levels of analysis; and the application of relevant and appropriate methodologies for operationalizing SKM. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bibliometric study; Intellectual structure; Research trends; Strategic knowledge management; Systematic literature review",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100526907

This paper believes that the existing qualitative assessments of this field can be experimentally verified and visualized. Design/methodology/approach: First, the key conceptual dilemmas of research perspectives in urban tourism are highlighted. Based on the Web of Science (WOS) Core Collection and the VOSviewer (computer program for visualizing bibliometric networks), the data will be analyzed. Clustering is used to evaluate information retrieval (inclusivity or selectivity of the search query), publication patterns (journal articles), author keywords, terminology and to identify the respective cities and author collaborations between countries. Findings: Terminological specificities and their contextuality (authors’ preferences) are elaborated, as the topic is studied by authors from different disciplinary fields. Compared to other specific tourisms, urban tourism includes geographic terms (variations of city names) and terms with different connotations (travelers, visitors). Recent Spanish (also Portuguese) linguistic/geographic contexts are noticeable and a strong presence of WOS Emerging Sources Citation Index papers. Research perspectives are represented in the network of clusters of connected terms. If the search is based on a narrower sense of strict urban tourism, then tourism-business topics predominate. If tourism and cities are less closely linked, socio-cultural and environmental-spatial perspectives emerge, as does tourism/cities vulnerability (climate change and health issues). Research limitations/implications: The construction of a search syntax for the purpose of retrieval is always marked by compromises, given different terminological usages. A narrow search query will miss many relevant documents. On the other hand, if the query is too general, it returns less relevant documents. To this end, this paper tested queries on three different levels of inclusivity or selectivity. More consistent use of terms would benefit authors in the field of urban tourism when searching for references (information retrieval) and, as a consequence, would allow better integration of the field. Practical implications: This study provides a practical method for evaluating cities and tourism in combining the expertise of an information scientist and a sociologist. It points out numerous caveats in information retrieval. It offers an overview of publishing just prior to the outbreak of Covid-19, thus providing an opportunity for further comparative studies. Originality/value: This study is the first to examine urban tourism using such a method and can serve as a complement to the existing systematization of qualitative approaches. The findings are consistent with numerous qualitative assessments of weak the research interconnection between the specifics of cities and tourism in terms of broader socio-spatial processes. However, the study suggests that such research linkage is increasing, which is noticeable in relation to issues of social sustainability (e.g. overtourism, Airbnb and touristification). © 2021, Marjan Hocevar and Tomaz Bartol.","Bibliometrics; Cities; Science mapping; Social change; Social sustainability; Urban tourism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107785510

Valuation of research and scholarly output predicts innovation, affects careers, and guides resource allocations worldwide. This book joins the burgeoning conversation in management and the social sciences with theoretical and applied discussions of the concepts, measurements, costs and benefits that accrue to pursuing scholarly impact. The author draws on a pioneering study by the Academy of Management that asked its global membership of 20,000 how they assessed scholarly impact, including rankings and impact factors, and how institutions supported this pursuit. Through qualitative and quantitative cross-country analysis by professorial rank, geographical region and support for various metrics, as well as exploration of parallel discussions in the social and hard sciences, the author argues for an urgent re-examination of the visible and invisible hands of research evaluation that shape lives and global societies. The book presents original data on the external impacts of management research on policy, through the media, and in interest displayed by constituencies, which will make the book of interest to researchers, academics and students in the fields of business and management.

The authors explore whether educational background attributes, such as a bachelor's degree from an elite institution and the field of study, influence CEO management style manifested in objectively measurable outcomes at the firm level. Design/methodology/approach: The authors construct a unique data set from various sources. The management-style variables encompass investment, financial, organizational strategy policy choices, and performance outcomes. They standardize the style variables by industry sector and express deviations from industry means into three categories (low, medium, high). The ordered logit models suggest that educational background attributes influence management style across several dimensions. Findings: The authors document numerous statistically and economically significant results. For instance, an elite education translates to superior market performance as measured by Tobin's Q. A background in science/technology manifests in more (less) spending on R&D (advertising) and less exposure to financial risk for the firm. The authors also find that gender plays almost no role, while CEO age has a nonlinear influence role in affecting management style. Research limitations/implications: The study posits that educational background plays an important role along several dimensions such as skill and character development, signaling and network building. While these effects are difficult to disentangle, they all arguably influence an individual's ability to perform complex tasks such as running a company. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the growing literature on the drivers of CEO style and performance. Previous studies have examined the role of a CEO's elite educational background on firm performance outcomes and have reported either no or limited association. In contrast, the authors document that an elite education is strongly linked to superior market performance but not to accounting-based performance measures. They also find that CEOs who major in science/technology exhibit markedly different management styles compared to their counterparts with backgrounds in business/economics or the humanities. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Age; CEO education; Corporate policy; Management style; Managerial traits; Performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106333227

Leveraging this premise, we examine marketing scholars’ contributions to the international business (IB) literature – specifically notable works in exporting and market entry. Despite the overarching role of marketing in business, our systematic examination of published works in JIBS identified only 11 marketing contributions among the top 100 most frequently cited publications. More recent Web of Science data for the most cited contributions since 2015 demonstrate a decline in the number of international marketing (IM) and IB-related contributions by marketing scholars. Our goal in this editorial is to re-emphasize marketing’s critical importance and centrality in IB research, especially with reference to its dominant role in such areas as exporting and market entry decisions, customer acquisition, and relationship management. This special issue is intended to highlight IM and to motivate more contributions by IM scholars, as well as to call for greater integration of marketing thought in IB research. © 2021, Academy of International Business.","central role of marketing; exporting; firm performance; international marketing-business; market entry; relationship management",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105977445

Publicized failures to replicate landmark studies, along with high-profile cases of research fraud, have led scholars to reconsider the trustworthiness of both findings and institutionalized research practices. This paper considers two questions: (1) Relative to psychology and economics, what is the state of replication and reproduction research in management? (2) Are the disciplines equally advanced in the use of methods applied to study the replication problem? A systematic literature review identified 67 studies pertinent to these questions. The results indicate that the replication prevalence rate in management studies lies almost exactly between those of psychology and economics, while a high level of variation between management and other business-related disciplines can be noted. Further, similarly to psychology, but unlike economics, the surveys of published replications tend to report high replication success rates for management and other business-related disciplines. However, a comparison with recently obtained results in preregistered multi-study replications in psychology and economics suggests that these rates are almost certainly inflated. Method and data transparency are medium to low, often rendering attempts to reproduce or replicate studies impossible. Finally, the understanding of the replicability problem in management is held back by the underutilization of methods developed in other disciplines. The review also reveals that management, psychology, and economics exhibit strikingly different practices and approaches to replication, despite facing similar incentive structures. Disciplines in which replication and reproduction attempts are rare and which frequently involve authors of the original study in replication attempts lack strong deterrents against questionable research practices; thus, they are less likely to deliver replicable results. © 2021 The Author","Data and code transparency; Replicability; Reproducibility",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099616011

(2018a), who identified a turning point between the concepts of business ecosystems and innovation ecosystems (IE) analysing studies from 1993 to 2016. The objective of this study is to present the characteristics, trends, and current research avenues of the concept post-transition, especially in the period from 2017 to 2019, during which more publications were produced than in the first 24 years. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from the Web of Science, we performed a systematic literature review, through bibliometric (n = 153 studies) and content analysis (n = 15 studies). Data were analysed through bibliometrix (a R-tool package) and reading of the studies selected. Findings: Our study revealed some new research suggestions linked to actors, infrastructure and financial capital for innovation; public policy, social capital, and development; IE Governance; and IE limits. Research limitation/implications: One limitation of our study is the fact that it only used the Web of Science database. Originality/value: Even though the literature on IE is extensive, no studies have captured the recent trends on this topic. These trends can be useful for 'new avenues' in IE research. The findings also can be important to clarify the concept of IE. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","innovation; Innovation ecosystem; systematic review; value creation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113812042

It is predicted that maximising entrepreneurs will perform better in their entrepreneurial ventures than satisficing entrepreneurs. In order to achieve improved outcomes, it is expected that maximisers will apply their preference for information search to develop more entrepreneurially oriented and market-oriented businesses. Data gathered from a sample of 172 entrepreneurs in the United States indicate that entrepreneurs who maximise outperformed their satisficing counterparts.

The paper undertakes quantitative analyses and visualization of the temporal trends, from VA's emergence in 2000 to the end of 2019. The trend analysis helps to forecast future growth in the research and practice of VA. The study highlights four outcomes. First, there is a robust direct relationship among the variables, including VA's growth on the Google trends, the scientific literature production (SLP), and usage of the published documents. Second, the SLP's growth pattern highlights VA's popularity as an emerging field with an overall annual increase of 17.4%. The high citation counts of the published scholarship indicate a significant impact and a continuous growth of the VA field. Third, VA contributes to diverse disciplines other than computer science and information systems, from business and economics to engineering, healthcare, biomedical and chemical sciences, and arts and humanities. VA helps researchers and practitioners in multidisciplinary fields analyze multidimensional data, enhance data visualization, knowledge discovery, generating insights, and make informed decisions. On the reverse, other disciplines contribute to propelling VA's popularity through research productivity, usage, and citation impacts.

In this regard, smart retrofitting has been introduced as a sustainable approach of transforming the current state of legacy equipment into smart and connected assets. By equipping the existing installed base with hardware and software as well as networking capability, smart retrofitting allows for new data-driven processes and business models. While we see a growing number of articles that focus on retrofitting in the context of smart manufacturing, there is still a lack of a uniform definition of smart retrofitting as well as a holistic understanding of its drivers, challenges, and benefits. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the retrofitting literature available through the online databases Scopus and Web of Science. We identified 23 particularly relevant academic articles for a detailed full-text analysis. In this full-text analysis, we searched for definitions of smart retrofitting and synthesized them into a novel definition. Furthermore, we inductively derived contextual drivers and challenges of smart retrofitting as well as retrofit benefits. This literature review provides an overview of the current body of knowledge on smart retrofitting. For academics, our findings show that current research on smart retrofitting focuses on new technologies and legacy systems but largely disregards transformational aspects regarding business models and servitization as well as sustainability aspects, although these deserve more attention in times of global climate challenges.

The thesis of the book is that the main impediment to progress in economics is ""false feedback"", which it defines as the false result of an empirical study, such as empirical evidence produced by a statistical model that violates some of its assumptions. In contrast to scientific fields that work with physical technologies, false feedback is hard to recognize in economics. Economists thus have difficulties knowing where they stand in their inquiries, and false feedback will regularly lead them in the wrong directions. The book searches for the reasons behind the emergence of false feedback. It thereby contributes to a wider discussion in the field of metascience about the practices of researchers when pursuing their daily business. The book thus offers a case study of metascience for the field of empirical economics. The main strength of the book are the numerous smaller insights it provides throughout. The book delves into deep discussions of various theoretical issues, which it illustrates by many applied examples and a wide array of references, especially to philosophy of science. The book puts flesh on complicated and often abstract subjects, particularly when it comes to controversial topics such as p- hacking. The reader gains an understanding of the main challenges present in empirical economic research and also the possible solutions. The main audience of the book are all applied researchers working with data and, in particular, those who have found certain aspects of their research practice problematic. © 2022 Andrin Spescha.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125613442

In Malaysia, the small business sector is most affected by the movement control order (MCO). The MCO has caused the closure of the retail and transport sectors that has sharply curtailed the daily operations of the majority of small entrepreneurs, leading to a loss in income. However, if small business communities make optimal use of digital applications for their business activities, their income will be less affected by the current Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the everyday use of ICT has the potential to create numerous landscape improvement and business continuity, specifically for small and medium entrepreneurs (SMEs). This, in turn, would increase community participation in entrepreneurship. Therefore, it is crucial to study the role of digital marketing in strengthening new business norms among small entrepreneurs during the Covid-19 pandemic. It is also imperative to identify other factors that can help boost digital business. This research examined the relationship between ICT use in empowering rural entrepreneurs during MCO in Malaysia. The study design consisted of a quantitative form for each research instrument using the Google Form online survey. This study's sample was selected using a particular sampling method (purposive sampling) and snowball sampling (snowball sampling) involving 158 small rural entrepreneurs in Penang, Malaysia. The data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 27.0 software. The findings showed that the respondents navigated the Covid-19 pandemic by carrying out business activities on the digital platform and took full advantage of the ICT applications as part of their new business norms. This study can provide input for the government to formulate strategies related to ICT in increasing awareness among rural entrepreneurs. Additionally, the input of this study can offer programs and activities to further enhance the entrepreneurs' skills in using ICT. © 2021 Abdul Rashid et al..

In contrast, successful IUCs in softer social sciences, such as business, remain relatively uncommon. But business research requires an even higher degree of collaboration than research in the hard sciences if its results are to be relevant to businesspeople. Fortunately, business academics are becoming more and more interested in collaborating with businesspeople. The purpose of this article is to motivate businesspeople to collaborate as well. We do this by showing the businessperson the historical origins of business research's irrelevance, by describing the benefits the business world could receive from collaborative research, by showing why collaboration is especially needed in social sciences such as business, and by showing why academics cannot do relevant business research without practitioners’ help.

The manager and his team are supported by a holistic framework. The role of data science and the needed data modelling techniques are essential for managing data models in a transformation project. For that reason, the development of the big data for AI (BGD4AI) is an essential start. © 2021, IGI Global.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128144331

This chapter presents two approaches to time series forecasting, long short-term memory (LSTM), a special kind of recurrent neural network (RNN), and Prophet, an open-source library developed by Facebook for time series forecasting. With a focus on developing forecasting processes by data mining or machine learning experts, LSTM uses gating mechanisms to deal with long-term dependencies, reducing the short-term memory effect inherent to the traditional RNN. On the other hand, Prophet encapsulates statistical and computational complexity to allow broad use of time series forecasting, prioritizing the expert's business knowledge through exploration and experimentation. Both approaches were applied to a retail time series. This case study comprises daily and half-hourly forecasts, and the performance of both methods was measured using the standard metrics. © 2021, IGI Global.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128137038

Modern organizations are immersed in data and are turning toward data science to address a variety of business problems. While numerous complex problems in science have become solvable through data science, not all scientific solutions are equally applicable to business. Many data-intensive business problems are situated in complex socio-political and behavioral contexts that still elude commonly used scientific methods. To what extent can such problems be addressed through data science? Does data science have any inherent blind spots in this regard? What types of business problems are likely to be addressed by data science in the near future, which will not, and why? We develop a conceptual framework to inform the application of data science in business. The framework draws on an extensive review of data science literature across four domains: data, method, interfaces, and cognition. We draw on Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety as theoretical principle. We conclude that data-scientific advances across the four domains, in aggregate, could constitute requisite variety for particular types of business problems. This explains why such problems can be fully or only partially addressed, solved, or automated through data science. We distinguish between situations that can be improved due to cross-domain compensatory effects, and problems where data science, at best, only contributes merely to better understanding of complex phenomena. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2021.","artificial intelligence; big data; complexity; cybernetics; Data science; machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Business problems; Compensatory effects; Complex problems; Computational statistics; Conceptual frameworks; Data intensive; Scientific advances; Scientific method; Data Science",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101842312

Industry 4.0, the latest phase of the industrial revolution and one which is garnering a lot of attention, offers a number of benefits to businesses such as efficiency, speed, quality, personalised production, and reduced costs. Therefore, results which can be achieved through the initial adaptation of businesses to Industry 4.0 are among today's most compelling technological issues. In this context, the idea of determining the effects of Industry 4.0 components on businesses, specifically on their organizational performance, is the main aim of this research. As part of “Turkey's Digital Roadmap” (2018), created by the Ministry of Science, Industry, and Technology, the province of Kayseri in Turkey was investigated within the scope of the country's plans to digitize industry. The province of Kayseri, with an intensive number of businesses there using more technology, is one of Turkey's leading industrial and commercial regions. The fact that these enterprises use the latest technologies in their production processes has enabled the acquisition of the correct data for this research. Accordingly, enterprises using Industry 4.0 technologies and working on behalf of Industry 4.0 in the Kayseri Organized Industrial Zone have been determined as the main target group for this data. In this context, data was collected using face-to-face interviews, surveys, and second-hand data collection methods with executives in businesses using Industry 4.0 technologies and those adapting themselves to the process. The findings of the study reveal that Industry 4.0 technology components affect the organizational performance and this effect is positive. The findings of this study are consistent with the findings in the literature. More broadly, the findings show that Industry 4.0 technology components increase organizational performance criteria such as profitability, sales, production amount, production amount per capita, capacity utilization rate, production speed, product quality, and can lead to significant reductions in production costs. These results are encouraging for businesses wanting to transition to Industry 4.0 and are important in terms of filling in the gaps in the literature and practice.

How are marketers using it to manipulate you? ""[Dr. Turow ] is encouraging policymakers and the public to do something I wish we did more often: Be careful and considerate about how we use a powerful technology before it might be used for consequential decisions.""-Shira Ovide, New York Times Only three decades ago, it was inconceivable that virtually entire populations would be carrying around wireless phones wherever they went, or that peoples' exact locations could be tracked by those devices. We now take both for granted. Even just a decade ago the idea that individuals' voices could be used to identify and draw inferences about them as they shopped or interacted with retailers seemed like something out of a science fiction novel. Yet a new business sector is emerging to do exactly that. The first in-depth examination of the voice intelligence industry, The Voice Catchers exposes how artificial intelligence is enabling personalized marketing and discrimination through voice analysis. Amazon and Google have numerous patents pertaining to voice profiling, and even now their smart speakers are extracting and using voice prints for identification and more. Customer service centers are already approaching every caller based on what they conclude a caller's voice reveals about that person's emotions, sentiments, and personality, often in real time. In fact, many scientists believe that a person's weight, height, age, and race, not to mention any illnesses they may have, can also be identified from the sound of that individual's voice. Ultimately not only marketers, but also politicians and governments, may use voice profiling to infer personal characteristics for selfish interests and not for the benefit of a citizen or of society as a whole. Leading communications scholar Joseph Turow places the voice intelligence industry in historical perspective, explores its contemporary developments, and offers a clarion call for regulating this rising surveillance regime. © 2021 by Joseph Turow.

In order to strengthen such relationships, higher education institutes (HEIs), including universities, have institutionalized intermediary organizations such as technology transfer offices (TTOs). It is only recently that research on these organizations has extended its focus from analyzing their functions and performance to the internal processes and practices of their work. Based on qualitative data derived from a process-related focused ethnography, this paper presents insights into the practices of a group of “transfer scouts”. Their distinctive feature is that they are deployed explicitly on the basis of their own scientific and engineering expertise to intensify the university-industry linkages in an East German region. Apart from mere mediation, these transfer scouts become co-creators of new knowledge and technologies in transfer processes. Their orientation towards science, their thematic specialization, their development of digital transfer instruments, their explicit intention to contribute to regional development, as well as their cross-institutional acting keeps them involved in co-creational and multidirectional knowledge-production and makes them active participants in those processes. For transfer intermediaries, these insights offer an extension of their identity as brokering actors between the academic and the business sectors. Since diverse actors operate in the regional transfer system and confront transfer scouts with tensions between cooperation and competition, negotiation processes can be fiercely contested, met by resistance, and accompanied by conflicts. With regard to complementary practices, as well as in the case of constructive relationships, a durable cooperation between TTOs and transfer scouts promises to generate potentially innovative impulses. But this is less a stable setting than an ongoing process that requires many additional functional competencies and supporting structures to be provided by the organizations. The question arises, whether such complex KTT structures can be successfully institutionalized outside the frame of a fixed term project. Only then is it possible to create realistic expectations towards KTT-intermediaries and establish transfer scouting as an attractive profession in its own right in the entrepreneurial university. © 2021","co-construction; co-evolutionary knowledge production; focused ethnography; intermediation; knowledge and technology transfer (KTT); Transfer scouts","Regional planning; Screen printing; Technology transfer; Cooperation and competitions; Engineering expertise; Entrepreneurial university; Regional development; Scientific knowledge; Supporting structure; Technology transfer offices; University-industry linkages; Engineering research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100263894

Benefiting from the sociology of morality literature’s increased attention to specific kinds of morality and engaging with economic sociology’s moral markets literature, we generate competing hypotheses about scientists’ value-driven attitudes toward patenting. The Civilizing Market thesis suggests scientists who prioritize universalism (i.e., concern for the welfare of all people) will tend to support patenting. The Destructive Market thesis, by contrast, suggests universalism will be correlated with opposition to patenting. We analyze survey data from biologists and physicists nested within academic organizations, which are nested within the following regions: France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Taiwan, Turkey, UK, and the USA. Employing multilevel analysis, we find correlational evidence to support the Destructive Market thesis.

Case overview/synopsis: The case is set during the COVID-19 pandemic and the South African Government’s response to the pandemic. A brief timeline is provided as part of the introduction to the case study, with the following being a timeline of the events: 14 March 2020, 114 South African citizens were repatriated from Wuhan the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak; 15 March 2020, South Africa’s President, Cyril Ramaphosa declares a National State of Disaster, and this includes various measures to protect against the spread of COVID-19, while the health-care system is geared up to deal with the pandemic. Among the measures implemented, travel bans from high-risk countries and closing of air-traffic, closing of land ports and banning of gatherings of more than 100 people; 23 March 2020, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a national lockdown beginning on 27 March 2020 for three weeks; 9 April 2020, President Ramaphosa extends the national lockdown by a further two weeks. The World Health Organisation (WHO) had commended South Africa on the swift action taken to curb the spread of the virus. Individuals and organisational leaders are grappling to make sense of the spread of the virus, and the barrage of the information that is being communicated through multiple channels, formal and informal. To make sense of the information, the case is premised on getting access to the raw data and conducting the analysis based on the publicly available data. The central requirement of the case is to compare the number of positive cases per million, based on the population data contained in the data set, of South Africa to a comparable country. Complexity/Academic level: Post-graduate students learning statistics as part of a degree programme. The case assumes no prior statistics knowledge and therefore is aimed at teaching the importance of the basics of statistical analysis and then progressing to tests for differences.

Building upon scholarly consensus regarding the necessity of multidisciplinary approaches to address such complex problems, the entrepreneurship classroom, broadly defined, can be a learning laboratory to integrate across disciplines, encouraging more impactful opportunity identification for students looking to create social, environmental, and economically inclusive value. We examined recent exit survey data from graduating seniors at a small, private business college in the US that emphasizes entrepreneurship, finding large gaps in skills and knowledge related to ethics and creative problem solving – both of which are key competencies central to meeting the challenges of building a more sustainable world. To address these identified needs, we developed a co-taught course focused on sustainability and consumerism across liberal arts, physical science, and business disciplines. We present our course material in the context of five key competencies related to teaching sustainability in higher education, and review the strengths and drawbacks of this approach for schools looking to implement a similar design. In a time of economic uncertainty in higher education, our model may be useful for other schools looking to integrate entrepreneurship across disciplines—with little added expense to the institution. © The Author(s) 2020.","co-teaching; consumerism; multidisciplinary; pedagogy; sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130096396

Thus, the need for productivity improvement in South Africa should be uppermost in both the public and private sector’s agenda. This can be achieved by implementing an effective management system that has a bearing to improved business performance. This sentiment underpins the concept of housekeeping methodology, namely, the 5S. 5S is a housekeeping philosophy represented by the practical approach for sorting, set in order, sanitise, standardise and sustain. As a result, this study evaluates the effectiveness of 5S on productivity in the automotive parts manufacturing companies in South Africa. 5S is an approach designed for achieving overall organisational cleanliness and standardisation at workplace that is motivating and pleasing to all the employees in the organisation. The study was quantitative in design and examined the production and related experiences of the automotive parts manufacturing company that has adopted a 5S strategy. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model, using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyse data. The company operates in the eThekwini District Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal. The study was achieved by collecting pre-and post-quarterly data for machine downtime and labour production output rate. The results establish that machine downtime has a relationship and statistically significant to productivity. However, productivity has no relationship with both the 5S and labour production output.

It recalls the (Sophist) concepts of imprecision, vagueness, and ambiguity, overcoming the common (Aristotelian/Boolean) logic founded on dichotomy. Fuzziness has been applied to economics and appears, for most part in cognitive contexts characterized by uncertainty and complexity, growingly adequate to business and information sciences. In this paper, our goal is to revisit and expose the future horizon value attributable to a business after n years (in the medium and long term, beyond the normal five-to-ten-year forecast period) through a fuzzy multivalent number, rather than a limiting crisp (single-valued) one. Since the 'continuing' or 'terminal' value is a big slice of the overall corporate value, such 'picture' results in an amusing and suggestive (impressionistic) visualization, as financial numbers are looked through deconstructing and zooming lens. Abductively, absolute conclusions on business values are precluded, but several levels of feasibility or adequacy are possible, showing a blurry multiplicity of gathered numbers. The fuzzy approach enlarges the extent of the sensitivity analysis made by the expert (appraiser) and enables the decision makers (administration) having for processes or predictions more information with characteristics of completeness, transparency, and credibility. Finally, the approach sheds light on different value possibilities rather than sharply estimating and releasing only one single (most likely) value. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Corporate valuation; discounted cash-flow (DCF) analysis; forecast period; fuzzy logic; terminal value","Computer circuits; Cost accounting; Data structures; Decision making; Economics; Forecasting; Lenses; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Corporate valuation; Corporate values; Decision makers; Discounted cash flow; Terminal values; Uncertainty; Uncertainty and complexity; Unconventional approaches; Fuzzy logic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065439323

This study responds to calls for more work in the business disciplines which have been overlooked by comparison and focuses on academic conferences as a higher education practice. Conferences are manifestations of the research being conducted within the discipline, representing the type of knowledge that is considered valuable, and who the thought leaders are considered to be. This study investigates whether equal representation of women at such conferences really matters, to whom and why. Design/methodology/approach: The research was designed using a critical feminist theory approach. An online survey was disseminated to academic staff and postgraduate students in the 25 top ranked business schools in Australia and New Zealand. A total of 452 responses were received, and thematic analysis was applied to open-ended responses. Findings: Equal representation does matter, for two sets of reasons. The first align with feminist theory perspectives of “equal opportunity” (gender is neutral), “difference” (gender is celebrated) or “post-equity” (the social construction of gender itself is problematic). The second are pragmatic consequences, namely the importance of role modelling, career building and the respect and recognition that come with conference attendance and visible leadership roles. Social implications: The findings have implications in regards to job satisfaction, productivity and the future recruitment and retention of women in academia. Furthermore, in areas where women are not researching, the questions and issues that are important to them are not receiving the attention they deserve, and this gender data gap has consequences for society at large. Originality/value: This study moves beyond simply identifying the under-representation of women at academic conferences in yet another field, to investigate why equal representation is important and to whom. It provides valuable evidence of the consequences of under-representation, as perceived by academics themselves. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academia; Conferences; Gender equality; Representation; Women",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096229280

Based on the comprehensive review of the state-of-the-science, this paper aims to identify significant research gaps in extant studies and develop potential future research agendas that may catalyse new streams of female entrepreneurship research. Design/methodology/approach: Bibliometric analysis via science mapping provides in-depth analyzes, highlights the intellectual structure and identifies hot topics. Using CiteSpace, co-citation networks of contributing countries, institutions, cited journals and authors are mapped first. Second, co-citation network analysis helps to identify the key “nodes” in the intellectual structure. The landscape view identifies main clusters from an overall perspective, while a timeline view delineates the characteristics and evolution of focal clusters. Major clusters are interpreted in detail with the help of foam tree graph processed by Carrot. Finally, the co-occurrence network analysis is conducted by using VOSviewer to examine hot topics and research frontiers Findings: The findings show that the publications of female entrepreneurship increase exponentially. The major driving force of female entrepreneurship research is from the USA and England. In terms of intellectual structure, key concepts behind different clusters represent the major milestones in relation to individual determinants of female entrepreneurship, the impact of cultural and contextual factors on female entrepreneurship and female entrepreneurship in non-OECD countries, as well as the impact of family, social and institutional factors on the survival and exit of male and female enterprises. Hot topics include financing sources, the embeddedness nature, the impact and environmental factors of female entrepreneurship. Practical implications: This study presents important practical implications. The findings suggest that intellectual communities of the female entrepreneurship field are relatively loose. Close contact and cooperation among different countries, institutions and researchers are lacking. To promote the evolution of the field, researchers who belong to different institutions in different countries may need to strengthen contact and cooperation. Additionally, papers in journals from the business and management discipline are most cited in this field, preventing new knowledge from other disciplines flowing into the female entrepreneurship field. Accordingly, female entrepreneurship research journals may need to expand their focus and combine knowledge from various domains. Originality/value: This bibliometric review provides a more comprehensive, systematic and objective review of the female entrepreneurship field. Previous qualitative reviews are typically based on personal judgement, while a few quantitative reviews only describe statistical data. This study is based on thousands of citation data rather than a small number of papers pre-selected by the researcher, thus, is more data-grounded and less biased than prior reviews. It expands previous reviews by transparently visualizing the underlying structure and evolution of the field. Moreover, it highlights significant gaps in extant studies and develops future research agendas to catalyse new streams of research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bibliometric analysis; CiteSpace; Female entrepreneurship; Intellectual structure; Science mapping",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086873356

The risk identification index system is established and its weight is assigned to provide the index basis of the input layer for the identification model. The BP neural network is improved by LM algorithm to reduce the probability of falling into local extreme value, and the audit credit guarantee risk identification model is established by using the improved network. Using the same audit credit guarantee risk sample to test the identification method, the identification accuracy of this method is 95.15%, which is 4.86% and 4.61% higher than that based on BP neural network and LVQ network respectively. Therefore, the identification results of the design method are more feasible. As a result of the Bio Revolution, businesses will have access to a whole new set of capabilities. New specialized skills in domains like genomics, molecular biology, biochemistry, and neurology will be in great demand, similar to the recent surge in data-science and software-engineering abilities. In fact, the combination of digital and biological expertise is a formidable one. These new capabilities are enabling more efficient and less expensive manufacturing processes, as well as better-performing inputs with superior properties, which in turn enable the delivery of goods and services with higher added value to end users.

Basing analysis on social media data such as Yelp is a challenging task because review data is highly sparse and direct analysis may fail to uncover hidden trends. To this end, we propose a deep autoencoder approach for embedding the language of neighbourhood-based business reviews into a reduced dimensional space that facilitates similarity comparison of neighbourhoods and their change over time. Our model improves performance in distinguishing real and fake neighbourhood descriptions derived from real reviews, increasing performance in the task from an average accuracy of 0.46 to 0.77. This improvement in performance indicates that this novel application of embedded language analysis permits us to uncover comparative trends in neighbourhood change through the lens of their venues' reviews, providing a computational methodology for reading a city through its neighbourhoods. The resulting toolkit makes it possible to examine a city's current sociological trends in terms of its neighbourhoods' collective identities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Computational social science; Machine learning; Neighbourhood analysis; Text embedding; Urban informatics","comparative study; machine learning; neighborhood; performance assessment; social media; trend analysis; urban society; Trachinotus falcatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097142424

It is literally relied upon or responsible for much of what we see and do on a daily basis, with many service systems designed and managed to perform as best as possible. This review paper highlights the increased application of optimization through geographic information systems (GIS) to support management and decision making. A broad perception in management science and optimization circles is that GIS is merely a database system facilitating access to data, mapping and summary analysis. However, optimization is actually available through basic functionality in many GIS packages. This review identifies many of the optimization capabilities available in GIS, and is significant because there is a steady and growing trend of publication in academic and other outlets reporting application efforts that rely on GIS-based optimization. GIS usage is facilitated by user-friendly point-and-click access. This no doubt explains increased management planning involving GIS, making this review important for many reasons. Availability of optimization tools and techniques in GIS translates into use, often by individuals that likely do not understand the underlying models and methods. The growing significance of contemporary GIS software as a management and business analytic medium makes this a timely and important review topic, and suggests that increased interest in the capabilities provided in GIS is essential in order to ensure that optimization methods are appropriately and meaningfully applied in practice. © 2019","Business analytics; Facility location; GIS; Spatial optimization","adult; decision making; geographic information system; perception; review; software",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076961821

The focus of the study is social network analysis (SNA). Design/methodology/approach: The research methodology is qualitative and consists of the review literature relevant to this thesis. This methodology is necessary to give an account of the methods and the techniques adopted for the data collection used in other economic sectors. Findings: SNA is needed to analyze the creation and configuration of communities of practice within destination and to identify possible barriers to effective interaction. Essentially, it is a complex adaptive socio-economic system. It shares many (if not all) of the characteristics usually associated with such entities, namely, non-linear relationships among the components, self-organization and emergence of organizational structures, robustness to external shocks. Research limitations/implications: The most important limit of this paper is that all the results presented here do not concern a single case study. Future research studies will provide a larger number of cases and examples to give the necessary validation to the findings presented here. Practical implications: This paper provides a view into the network of relationships that may give tourism organization managers a strong leverage to improve the flow of information and to target opportunities where this flow may have the most impact on regulatory or business activities. Originality/value: SNA can help to detect actual expertise and consequently project the potential losses deriving from an inefficient flow of knowledge. In addition, the authors will be able to define roles in the organizational networks and make an evaluation of informal organizational structures over the formal ones. Traditional organizational theories lack a concrete correspondence with mathematical studies and in this respect the authors sought to identify a correspondence. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Complex systems; Destination management; Hospitality; Network analysis; Network science; Quantitative methods",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085871368

They were not more than duplicity of forged cheques, draining peoples or investors' money through fake company formations, and minutest scrutinization of the loan documents etc. These were the only means for the fraudsters to play around. It is only after the advancement and adoption of desktop culture we have witnessed the whole new age of cybercrime and digital frauds. Investors, retailers, businesses and corporates none were spared and were hard hit. Since then, financial frauds have become intimidating for businesses and especially for the banks across the globe. With the advent and continuous advancement of technology it has further complicated the ways and means for the fraudsters ending up into catastrophic consequences.

The present article examines the structure and dynamics of cultural intelligence in the context of business research by means of a bibliometric study, and further identifies the main themes explored thus far in the literature and their practical implications. In order to achieve the aforementioned objectives, a bibliographic research of business scientific papers published in the Scopus database was carried out comprising a period of fifteen years (from 2004 to 2018), followed by a science mapping study based on the final sample data collected (262 documents), where a co-word analysis in a longitudinal framework was performed using SciMAT.

The model indicates that trust and loyalty are influenced by a) the social media shared beliefs between the vendor and the customer; b) the nature of the vendor's social media communication with the customer; and c) the extent to which the vendor's social media communication practices enable effective customer-to-customer communication. Trust is found to have a mediating role between these indicators and loyalty.

Particularly, in the manner of cooperating with people at the bottom of socio-economic pyramid, multinational enterprises can alleviate public poverty and thus promoting sustainable development at the BoP regions. However, the general state and trend of sustainable development-related studies in the BoP domain are not clear; the popular keywords and theoretical orientations have yet to been determined. This study aims to address these issues by analyzing 273 high-impact articles in the related field from the Web of Science database between 2002 and 2018. A mixed review method is adopted, which combines quantitative bibliometric analysis with qualitative content analysis. The results show that an increasing number of sustainable development-related studies are emerging from the BoP domain, particularly concerning social and economic sustainability in developing countries (or regions). Four theoretical orientations are identified, namely subsistence market, sustainable solution, corporate social responsibility and inclusive business.

In the transitional economic, social, cultural, and technological contexts, given the anguish of establishing or not the information and knowledge society, it is purely remarkable that informational conflicts happen in a devastating manner, negatively affecting the producers, recipients, and makers of this world: people. Many refute the efficiency and effectiveness of the knowledge management process, with the justification that managing knowledge is impossible, since it is not palpable. On the other hand, there are those who argue that knowledge management is a process composed of activities that aim to make possible the production, availability and sharing of consistent, effective, functional, and true knowledge in environments, in order to make it available for better decision-making, since before it became known, it was necessary to deal with data and information. Therefore, knowledge management does not deal with autocracy, as it is a democratic, conscious process that is committed to the truth and that fights against misinformation, as well as against false news that contributes to people's authoritarianism, ignorance, and inferiority, precisely because untrue information will be assimilated and will result in malicious knowledge. For Edgar Morin, who defends the theory of complexity, the classic thinking of science is based on three pillars, among them order, separability, and reason. What can be inferred is that the excess of reason can become blind to the point that subjective aspects, which are also part of the process of transforming objectivity, suffer a certain negation. In addition, order and separability, during all these years, have also been responsible for the lack of synergy and interdependence that exists in corporations, organizations, social networks and people's homes. It may even sound strange to say that there is no synergy and interdependence in social networks, but this statement is precisely defended when visualizing the loneliness and despair established in these environments, justified by the eternal and constant search for acceptance and belonging, which most of the times do not becomes contemplated. Also, according to the author Edgar Morin, complex thinking does not aim to replace separability with inseparability but defends a dialogical relationship that uses separability in an inseparable context, that is, that calls for responsible action by all sectors of society here already mentioned: economic, social, cultural, scientific, and technological. Thus, this chapter aims to approach the concept of knowledge management from a more expansive perspective, which is not only in the business sphere, based on the complexity theory. As a hypothesis, having knowledge management as a concept originating from information science, the author argues that this is a scientific field that contributes to a more conscious capitalism in consumption and informational production, even because it is necessary for the control of other types of consumption, as private, public, essential, and superfluous, among others. To address the aspects of complexity in knowledge management and reflect on the referred hypothesis, a qualitative and bibliographic research was carried out. © 2021, IGI Global.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137495992

Based on the social exchange theory and social learning theory, this study scrutinized the impact of ethical leadership on the presentation of ethical conduct by employees through the ethical climate. Notably, this study scrutinised the moderating function of the person-organisation fit (P-O fit) in relation of ethical climate and the ethical conduct of employees. Design/methodology/approach: To evaluate the research hypotheses, two-wave data were collected from 295 individuals who are currently employed in various Iraqi organizations (i.e. manufacturing, medical and insurance industries). Findings: In line with the hypotheses, the outcomes from a sample of 295 workers working in different Iraqi entities exhibited a positive relation between the ethical behaviour of leaders and the ethical conduct of employees in the ethical climate. Moreover, it was observed that the P-O fit of employees moderated the relationship between ethical climate and the ethical conduct of employees such that the relationship was more robust for those with a high P-O fit in comparison to those with a low P-O fit. Research limitations/implications: The primary limitation of this study is in the data, which was obtained from a single source. Although the study conducted two surveys and utilised a mediation and moderation variables model that was less likely to be influenced by common method bias (CMB) (Podsakoff et al., 2012), one cannot completely rule out CMB. Apart from the potential effects of the CMB, the consistency of the empirical findings could have also been compromised since self-reported data were utilised in measuring ethical behaviour, which can be a very complex and sensitive issue. For this reason, the social desirability response bias cannot be ruled out completely. When possible, future studies must gather data from multiple sources. Furthermore, supervisors must evaluate the ethical behaviour of employees. Another limitation was that the findings of this study were based on a sample in a Middle Eastern cultural context such as in Iraq. Perhaps, the particular cultural features of this context, which encompassed, among other things, a strong adherence to religious values (Moaddel, 2010), could have influenced the findings of this study. It is true that the effects of differences (P–O fit) are highly likely to replicate across cultural contexts (Triandis et al., 1988). However, it can be seen that further studies are needed to evaluate the context-sensitivity of these findings (Whetten, 2009) by analysing other cultures, where the importance of religiosity is on the decline (i.e. in Western countries, Ribberink et al., 2018) or where the cultural features are very much different from those that apply to Iraq. Lastly, other external factors were not taken into account by this study as it tried to explain ethical behaviour. Ethics is a highly complex subject and is influenced by numerous variables at the organisational, individual and external environment levels. Thus, caution must be observed when making inferences from the present study which, to a certain degree, offered a simplified version of ethical behaviour by concentrating on a few variables such as the Arab culture's traditional ideology, which dominates even science (Abu Khalil, 1992). In addition, there are the political conflicts in the Middle Eastern cultural context such as what is happening in Iraq (Harff, 2018). Thus, it is important to include such aspects in future researches. Practical implications: In terms of management, the findings send a clear signal to those in the upper echelon that, without ignoring the issue of ethics in organizations, employees are a critical aspect to be taken into account to encourage ethical behaviour at the workplace. This study has important practical implications. First, this study determined that ethical leadership (here, of the supervisors) positively influences the behaviour of subordinates (refers to the supervisors here); this in turn further improves the ethical behaviour of employees. It is vital that managers or supervisors are motivated to practice ethical leadership because they directly influence the employees. It has been suggested that top managers, especially chief executive officers, have the ability to shape the ethical climate, which also influences the ethical behaviour of employees further. This study offered several feasible ways that managers can apply to achieve that. In particular, top managers may utilise the ethical climate as a way of communicating the ethical values that they have to their subordinates, thereby serving as a motivation for the subordinates to adopt an ethical behaviour. It was also suggested by this study that ethical climate and the P–O fit may, to some degree, substitute each other as they influence the ethical behaviour of employees. Therefore, firms that were identified to have a low level of ethical standards, practices, and policies, at least from the employees' perspective, are better poised to conduct ethical issues in order to construct the ethical behaviour of their subordinates. More importantly, it is highly essential that the value congruence between an organization and its followers be considered. Social implications: This study highlighted the notion of ethics and how it’s essential for society. Ethics refer to the norms, standards, and values that direct the behavior of an individual. Ethical behaviour is vital in society because we need to be treated with respect as human beings. Originality/value: This study responds to recent calls for more research to identify factors which may strengthen or mitigate the influence ethical behavior in the workplace such as ethical leadership, ethical climate and Person–Organization. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ethical behaviour; Ethical climate; Ethical leadership; Person–organizationfit; Social exchange theory; Social learning theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086335107

AI is one of the front digital transformation strategies which can spread in the area of finance today. The use of this AI can improve core banking operations and tailor services which in turn will deliver over $250 billion in value across the industry (According to the McKinsey Global Institute). The banking sector of India as a financial service have recognized the potential and prospects of AI and ML and therefore it is being applied in almost all activities of banking operations. Analysts and experts estimate that AI will save roughly $1 trillion of the banking industry by 2030 [3]. According to Narrative Science, 32% of the participating banks in their 2018 report are already incorporating predictive analytics, recommendation engines, voice recognition and response times in their processes. ML is just a subset of AI which helps banks in bringing several benefits through analyzing mounds of financial data. Nowadays the traditional banking business is undergoing an exciting period of disruption, and at the same time it is evident from the 21st century that the worldwide banking sector is becoming digitalized as the trend spreads across the globe. Due to enormous changes with customer preferences, all industries now, including the banking sector, are adopting innovative methods to match the pace with changing demand and AI, ML and robotics are few among them. AI and ML impacts are clearly manifested in many areas of banking sector like credit scoring, creditworthiness, personal assistance, market research, fraud detection and asset management etc. AI is rapidly reshaping the business landscape of the financial industry including the banking industry. Banks should implement the AI technology in order to become more relevant and competitive, to provide personalized experience to customers, to improve and enhance the profit margin and to survive in the market amongst cutthroat competition. With the numerous available relevant technologies, application of AI and have deeply penetrated the banking sector and it is not only modernizing but also transforming this sector into a new horizon. Through the use of AI and ML the banks are leveraging the benefits of reduction in human error, strengthening customer base, reducing fraud, enhancing security and defence through utilizing knowledge data base and also controlling risk through minimizing credit score of customers. Nowadays, operation of banks is becoming more methodical and AI and ML have metamorphose every aspect of banking sector and has made its process faster. There are so many digital platforms used under AI and ML which are helpful to the banks for doing their business and operation smoothly. Some of them are handy while handling customer service, detection of fraud, creation of facial bio metrics and others are generous for computing the credit score and handling the customer queries. Few of these techniques used by the banks especially under AI are KASISTO (KAI), PEPPER, HooYu, DATAVISOR. PLAID and ZESTFINANCE etc. which prove to be, crucial for the banking sector for their glossy performance. So, it can be concluded form the study that in the banking sector the application and adoption of AI and ML enhances efficiency, increases profitability, serve customers more efficiently, offers data insights and manages risk of banks. AI and ML is proved to be the poised agitator for the banking industry. It is estimated by the experts that AI will bring huge gain to the banking industries which could be realized over the coming decades. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131494813

The impact justifies the company's current commercial state and also helps to bring in new customers. The proposed exploratory data analysis shows the relationship between the reviews on textual and non-textual parameters aimed to work on a user-based analysis. In this paper two different datasets are analyzed where the reviews are predicted based on extensive exploratory data analysis and feature engineering. This paper focused on examining how reviews are influenced based on the independent parameters from Zomato and Yelp datasets. These datasets have huge geographical differences that allowed us to obtain various diverse users-review coming from different backgrounds, cultures, and heritage. After feature construction, the predictive model is analyzed by applying supervised and ensemble machine learning algorithms such as Linear regression, Logistic regression, Decision trees, RandomForest, XGBoost, and GradientBoosting. The inferences obtained from both datasets gave us coherent results that validate the experimental procedures, extend the same analogy in different business paradigms, and offer a comprehensive prediction. © 2021 IEEE.","data science; ensemble machine learning; exploratory data analysis; feature engineering; reviewing system","Data handling; Data Science; Learning algorithms; Logistic regression; Machine learning; 'current; Business ventures; Data ensemble; Data feature; Ensemble machine learning; Exploratory data analysis; Feature engineerings; Machine learning algorithms; Reviewing system; Technological advancement; Decision trees",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130586799

We examine the potential usefulness of theoretical concepts and empirical analyses in related fields such as ecology, management, regional science, and planning. We contend that there exists no single best approach to defining or measuring resilience across disciplines and that research should evolve to fit specific applications, though adhering to sound principles within each discipline. We illustrate the usefulness of our conceptual foundations in the design of an econometric analysis of economic resilience and summarize its application to survey data from two major disasters. In relation to the themes of this volume, economic resilience can serve to reduce entropy by countering the disarray in an economy in the aftermath of a disaster. At the microeconomic level, this also intersects with complexity in terms of synergies within an individual firm, and at the macroeconomic level manifests itself most notably through supply-chain interactions and network effects. In terms of spatial dynamics, it relates to geographic shifts in the location of economic activity by actual physical relocation of businesses, shifts of activity to branch plants, and the rebalancing of trade across regions. © Aura Reggiani, Laurie A.

Drawing on research from public administration, psychology, business, network science, social work, and communication, it synthesizes what we know about how to best design and manage networks. It includes illustrations from 30 original case studies; they describe groups of organizations addressing issues such as gender-based violence, educational outcomes, senior care, veterans' services, mental health and wellness, and climate change. Additionally, the volume describes critical issues that leaders address in creating and managing networks, including social issue analysis, network governance, securing and managing funding, dealing with power and conflict, using data effectively, and managing change. Each chapter includes tools for network leaders to use to handle these issues. This book is neither a Pollyannaish, pro-collaboration account of the benefits of network approaches, nor is it a critical view of these efforts. Instead, it highlights the opportunities and challenges of networks. © Oxford University Press 2022.

Despite the various benefits (e.g., security, availability) little is empirically known about the development of such solutions. Where practitioners face numerous design decisions, we complement research by deriving six design principles for the construction of an applicable artifact in road transport. Methodology: We follow design-science-research to generate design knowledge based on a literature review, a morphological analysis, and case studies on DLT-driven applications for document management. We refine the results and demonstrate practicability via an instantiation based on expert interviews to provide generalizability in terms of actionable guidelines. Findings: We extend theory showing that DLT is an effective solution for cross-border information exchange. The design principles address the data architecture, access and storage across multiple stakeholders, and the way how data is exchanged. The results may further accelerate the adoption of DLT-based applications in logistics. Originality: We bridge the gap between technology and practical utilization by evaluating existing cross-industry use cases combining elements from the business, legal, and information technology perspective. Additionally, the instantiation of an applicable solution is further the result of an inter-organizational development process involving feedback of various practitioners (e.g., carrier, authorities). © 2021 Proceedings of the Hamburg International Conference of Logistics.

In this study, the research questions regarding logistics applications are as follows: (1) What are suitable use cases for RPA in logistics? (2) Which criteria support the selection of appropriate processes? (3) How should a procedure model for implementation be designed to systematically support the introduction while considering critical success factors? Methodology: This study follows the design science research process by Peffers et al. (2006). The research gap was identified through an extensive literature analysis, reflecting the state of research. Insights gained were compared with empirical data from the use of RPA at a case company. Findings: A procedure model was designed to systematically consider success factors for an implementation, comprising (1) initiation; (2) piloting; (3) deployment; and (4) ongoing governance, maintenance, and continuous improvement. Originality: RPA can contribute to solving challenges such as increased service demands from customers, combined with cost pressures and a shortage of skilled labor. The procedure model closes a research gap, both from a scientific perspective and from the practitioners' viewpoint, supporting an efficient and effective implementation. The consideration of knowledge from both theory and practice ensures practical relevance and significantly expands the state of research. © 2021 Proceedings of the Hamburg International Conference of Logistics.

Up until now, most of the current studies focus on digital transformation in advanced and dense societies, especially urban areas and technologies. Hence, the phenomenon of DT is under-researched in the context of rural and sparsely populated contexts. This study aims at exploring how a rural living lab (RLL) can be shaped and how this approach can be designed to support digital transformation processes in rural contexts. In so doing, following a design science research methodology (DSRM) approach, we have made an artefact (that is, RLL framework) that is an “instantiation” that supports user centric digitalization of rural areas. The designed framework is developed based on the key components of “traditional” and “urban” living labs, as well as empirical data which was collected within the context of the DigiBy project. The DigiBy project aims at conducting DT pilots in rural areas to elevate peoples' understanding of digitalization and the application of digitalization opportunities for service development in rural areas in the north of Sweden. As a result of these studies, five key components that guide the design of digital transformation pilots in rural areas emerged, namely: 1) rural context, 2) digitalization, 3) governance, control, and business mode, 4) methods facilitating DT processes, and 5) quintuple helix actors. We also offer an empirically derived definition of the rural living lab concept, followed by avenues for future research. © 2021 Carleton University.

A comparative assessment of the level of innovative development in seven regions of the Far North of Russia (FNR) for 2017 was carried out based on statistical data from the composite integrated index. A version of the Triple Helix (TH) econometric model served as the foundation for the assessment. This article presents the analytical results according to three elements of the TH model: the effectiveness of research and development (science), the effectiveness of innovation (industry), and budget expenditure on science and innovation (government). Regional innovative profiles were built during the analysis, which helped identify the strengths and weaknesses of the influence of science, business, and government on the development of innovative activities in the region. The results of such ratings make it possible to assess the comparative advantages and disadvantages of specific regions for further analysis. The data can be used in program documents on the region’s innovative development. The methodology proposed for an innovation activity rating can help predict the main development trends of the entire territory of the Far North.

The motivation of research lies with the facts of exploring effective inherent connectivity between unconventional petroleum systems. The connectivity between energy reservoir systems is ambiguous within a distinctive petroleum ecosystem. Heterogeneity and multidimensionality of unstructured data sources are additional challenges, precluding systematic modelling of diverse petroleum systems and their data integration process, including growing demand for storage systems. The research aims to establish the knowledge-based connectivity between petroleum systems through Information System (IS) articulations, visual analytics and data management. Method: We investigate the knowledge-based IS guided exploration and production systems to explore the connectivity between diverse unconventional petroleum systems and forecast the reservoir energy. We articulate Design Science Information System (DSIS), bring various IS artefacts, unify multiple domains of petroleum provinces and analyze the associativity between petroleum systems. In addition, use, reuse, effectiveness and interoperability are utility properties of IS artefacts that we evaluate. We implement IS solutions in the oil and gas industries to facilitate database management and reservoir energy exploration. Results: We simulate DSIS as an Unconventional Digital Petroleum Ecosystem (UDPE) as it allows us to investigate and ascertain the interplay between petroleum systems’ elements and processes. Metadata cubes are computed for data views to visualize, interpret, and implement IS articulations in energy systems. We compute the structure and reservoir attribute views for interpreting energy-driven petroleum systems, prospect evaluation and business-knowledge management with a viable DSIS solution. Conclusions: The DSIS emerges as a knowledge-based digital ecosystem innovation, demonstrating how it can effectively interconnect geographically controlled petroleum systems. Its development, in the exploration of unconventional shale basins, is a knowledge-based reservoir-energy management solution. This research is beneficial to IS practitioners who wish to pursue energy research in reservoir ecosystem contexts. © Association for Information Systems.","Big Data; Data Mining; Design Science; Digital Ecosystem; Unconventional Reservoirs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123380784

In this context, the research aims to identify and classify development factors of such activity in regions described in the international scientific literature. We analysed works obtained from international (Scopus and Web of Science) and Russian (Elibrary.ru, journal websites) databases using the search terms “regional foreign economic activity”, “regional export”, “global challenges”, “export support”, “foreign investments”, etc. 143 Russian- and English-language articles and books published in the period 1980–2021 were chosen. Selected works, focused on Russian federal districts and regions, as well as advanced and emerging countries, describe various approaches to examining the specificity and development patterns of world regions. Based on the data, we performed structural analysis of foreign economic activity factors using the method of multi-parameter classification. The revealed factors were compared and divided into homogeneous groups with multilevel structures (macro-groups — groups — subgroups — individual factors). After analysing the variety of approaches, we identified five macro-groups of factors: 1) global challenges and partner country factors; 2) resource, industrial, transport and infrastructure potential; 3) organisational factors (finances, specialists’ skills, business community); 4) investment, innovation and image potential; 5) state support of foreign economic activity. The proposed classification considers the development of global, national, regional entities, as well as FEA participants and individuals, taking into account both direct and indirect factors. The research findings can be used for developing short-, medium- and long-term approaches, models and forecasts of regions’ foreign economic activity. © 2021 Institute of Economics, Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

The skill mismatch in transition economies tends to be even more pronounced as the labour markets in these countries are characterized by structural unemployment, affecting both older workers with obsolete skills and the young ones. Employers face poor incentives for investing in workforce skill development, due to the inadequate investment climate and volatile business environment. Transition countries face increasing outward mobility of an educated workforce, loss of human capital, and shortage of workforce in the fields such as ICT, medicine, science and research. The research is based on empirical data generated in a survey on ICT and manufacturing enterprises in the City of Niš, Serbia. The research methodology combines workers' self-assessment method for the skill gap measurement and the competence approach combined with the statistical methods. The findings indicate the presence of a qualification mismatch, in the form of the over-qualification as a dominant irregularity in the analysed labour market. The results of the study are expected to contribute to creating a network of policy instrumentaria that tend to be effective on a sub-national level in addressing the mismatch. © 2021, University of Rijeka.

In the requirements engineering community, there has been a growing interest in considering digital data as new sources for requirements elicitation, in addition to stake-holders. The volume, dynamics, and variety of data makes iterative requirements elicitation increasingly continuous, but also unstructured and complex, which current agile methods are unable to consider and manage in a systematic and efficient manner. There is also the need to support software evolution by enabling a synergy of stakeholder-driven requirements elicitation and management with data-driven approaches.

At the same time theories of regional economics, in particular theories of ""growth points"" or ""development kernels"", regional self-development potential, territorial agglomeration, etc. are being developed and applied. The experience in the implementation of innovation strategies in recent years has shown a clear lack of administrative resources and investment injections into individual programs and centres. The innovation economy requires the formation of a development basis in the unity of productive forces and production relations. At present the processes of development of innovative economy are restrained both by the existing problems of financing of science, modernisation of scientifi c laboratories and institutes base, and by the problems of training of innovation-active personnel of specialists. Undoubtedly, the lag in scientific and technical support of educational process, interaction with production, availability of necessary practice base, insufficient innovative activity of business in this direction, its low financial opportunities have a negative impact. Thus, modern innovative production necessitates the expansion of integrative links between science, education and production not only in reproduction, but also in the territorial aspect. Integrated formations of science, education and production become the basis for innovation development of the economy, and their interaction goes beyond the boundaries of one administrative unit and extends to adjacent, cross-border territories. In this connection development of theory, methodology and recommendations for practice of spatial integration of science, education and production, formation of spatially localized innovative subsystems of transboundary territories on the basis of their innovation potential is an actual problem, which has not received proper attention in modern economic researches. This article deals with the issues of identifying points of growth of innovation ecosystems of the regions initiating the creation of world-class science and education centres, as well as a comparative assessment of their scientific and human resource potential competitiveness, using the data of the 2019 university performance monitoring. The data on the performance of research and education centres established in Russia in 2019 and 2020 were used as the information base for this study. A set of methods, including methods of theoretical analysis, comparison and generalization, was used to solve the research tasks. The scientific novelty and originality of the article is the proposed approach to ensuring sustainable development of the region based on the maximum involvement of growth factors of scientific and human resources potential of key actors of regional innovation systems with the use of mechanisms of scientific and educational integration in the form of science and education centres.","Innovative development; Potential; Region; Russia; Scientific and educational center; University","Competition; Personnel training; Planning; Sustainable development; Condition; Economic globalization; Innovations process; Innovative development; Potential; Region; Resource potentials; Russia; Science education; Scientific and educational center; Regional planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121608591

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology adopted in this study was a systematic literature review aided by the use of SciMAT, a scientific mapping software. Documents were collected from the Web of Science and Scopus database from 2011 to 2020 using the words “Textile” and “Industry 4.0” that result in 865 documents and 115 were analyzed. Findings: The literature review showed that the textile industry in the international context is at an incipient stage of the implementation of Industry 4.0. The main aspects of Industry 4.0 that were identified in the textile industry initially focus on the implementation of technologies aimed at computerization and automation of processes, whose main focuses are increasing productivity and reducing costs. Projects for the implementation of augmented reality and 3D printing and simulation technologies in the textile industry, clothing and apparel area are still embryonic, normally implemented through tools and software oriented toward the creation and development of new models of processes, products and commerce. Research limitations/implications: The search in the databases was carried out on October 17, 2020. Therefore, for future study, other combinations of search terms and time update are suggested, in addition to including more databases besides Scopus and Web of Science. Practical implications: This literature review served as the basis for the development of a questionnaire that was applied to 72 people in an industry in the clothing sector, located in the state of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. Social implications: The benefits of industry 4.0 are perceived in people with its implementation, such as a reduction in energy consumption of around 15%, an increase of up to 25% in work efficiency, in addition to more assertive decision-making, improvement of processes and balance between life and work. Originality/value: Machine learning, artificial intelligence, smart fabrics, IoT, supply chain management, environmental protection, Big Data, autonomation and cyber physics were the strongest terms found, consolidating as a prominent field for current and future studies. From emerging and/or still unexplored areas of Industry 4.0 in the textile sector, there is real-time communication, computer applications, carbon, fibers, health care and sustainable development. Some strategic actions that are taking place in some countries are summarized and in Brazil the adoption rate is 29% for this sector, revealing itself as a needy area and suitable for the development of studies that address the subject. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","4th Industrial revolution; Apparel; E-business; Emerging technologies; Industry 4.0; Textile",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121287164

Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper which utilizes qualitative research methods. Bibliometric analysis is applied to the selected 35 articles from specific databases which include not only the general tourism industry but also subsectors of airline, hospitality, restaurant, etc. Articles in this study fixate on the family businesses within the tourism industry. Findings: In total, 35 articles are found with the keywords “family business and tourism”, “family business and hospitality and hotels”, “family business and restaurant” and “family business and airline”. Though the family business studies focus on hospitality, tourism and restaurants as F&B, there is a research gap in the subsectors like rent-a-car companies, travel agencies and tour operators and recreation facilities. Overall qualitative research design is preferred, but majority of the authors’ focus is on business development, profit, performance and succession. For further studies, quantitative analysis on research gap areas are recommended. Research limitations/implications: The most general limitation is that only specific selected databases are used for the data gathering process such as double reviewed indexed journals published within Web of Science, Emerald, Elton B. Stephens Company (EBSCO) and Elsevier databases from the period of 1970s. Some other databases and some different periods may be considered as well as different keywords for other research. Secondly, few studies have analyzed quantitative data, since the specific nature of the family business dynamics require qualitative data.

Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted. A Web-based survey was also conducted to collect data from participants who were not able to participate in the in-depth interviews. Thematic content analysis was used to analyze the collected data. Findings: As a result of the analysis, three main themes were developed related to “chokepoints” that Afghan female engineers face along the path to starting their own construction companies: “entering and studying engineering,” “career development” and “starting her own engineering business”; the authors address the subthemes of barriers and opportunities confronted by Afghan women at each chokepoint. Research limitations/implications: Due to civil unrest, the authors are only able to reach a sample of Afghan female engineers working in the capital city of Kabul. Practical implications: Afghanistan shows, perhaps, the most severe underrepresentation of female engineers of all countries in the world, yet no research gives them a voice to explain the challenges their face to starting their own engineering/construction businesses. The authors are able to report their perceptions and articulate recommendations to encourage female entrepreneurship in the engineering/construction sector in Afghanistan. Social implications: Afghan women face significant barriers to having meaningful careers in the science, technology, engineering and medicine professions. The findings provide information for regulators regarding why Afghan women do not start their own engineering firms.

In this context, augmented reality provides promising solutions by allowing an end-to-end process of capturing objects, directly labeling them and immediately embedding the data in training processes. Consequently, this paper deals with the development of an object labeling application for crowdsourcing communities following the design science research paradigm. Based on seven issues and twelve corresponding meta-requirements, we developed an AR-based prototype and evaluated it in two evaluation cycles. The evaluation results reveal that the prototype facilitates the process of object detection, labeling and training of CNNs even for inexperienced participants.

This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of this subject by focusing on two key dynamics of technological cooperation. First, the authors focus on the ability of public funding to support regional technological demand through the promotion of science and technology-based innovation (STI) and innovation based on learning-by-doing, learning-by-using, learning-by-interacting (DUI) cooperation. Second, the authors investigate whether such cooperation patterns influence the companies’ ability to support the development of novel products through the effective transfer of knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: The data used in this longitudinal study are taken from the Basque statistics agency’s (EUSTAT) technological innovation survey, which compiles activities, personnel, funding sources, support institutions and other innovation-related aspects of businesses in the Basque region. The survey was carried out following the methodology of the community innovation survey (CIS). CIS data are used to generate official innovation statistics for the EU and its member countries and have been used extensively for analysis in economics. The sample included an unbalanced panel of 17,431 companies that reported research and development expenditure for the period 2013‐2017. Findings: The results of the analysis confirm that the relationship between STI cooperation and regional funding is positive (Piñeiro-Antelo and Lois-González, 2019), but regional DUI cooperation will have a greater impact than STI cooperation on a company’s ability to generate novel products. The authors can, therefore, say that public funding is successful at supporting cooperation between science and technology agents and firms but fails to promote the transfer of knowledge and subsequent development of novel products in companies in the region. Practical implications: Following a quadruple helix approach, it is important to underline the need for public policies to strengthen the connections between all the key agents in the ecosystem (where the research community, industry, public sector and citizens are all active actors), promoting technology transfer and dissemination, as well as trust among the parties, absorptive capacity and business access to resources and financing. Thus, the design of public policies should be oriented to support a firm’s innovation, balancing the exploration and exploitation of STI and DUI regional cooperation. Originality/value: The contribution of this research is threefold. First, it serves to emphasize the importance of the impact of regional innovation systems on business innovation modes and their performance. Second, it takes the study of innovation systems and their impact on companies a step further by examining the impact of public funding on the companies’ ability to explore and exploit regional innovation modes. Thirdly, the authors offer a dynamic view of the region’s ability to support its own demand for technology and study the impact of regional business modes on the firms’ ability to support novel products. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business modes of innovation; DUI; Innovation; Regional innovation system; STI",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117579394

Prior studies in entrepreneurship-related disciplines carry the implicit notion that p-hacking is predominantly an issue in top-tier journals, where incentives to do so may be highest. This study investigates p-hacking in the family business literature, a research field with roots in the broader entrepreneurship and small business literatures, and in which discourse increasingly takes place in both dedicated field journals and in the top-tier outlets in entrepreneurship and management. Analyses of p-values published in these field- and top-tier journals allow for a comparison of the prevalence and correlates of p-hacking at these different levels of prestige. The findings suggest that p-hacking is an issue of substantial—and statistically indistinguishable—magnitudes in both field- and top-tier journals. We further observe negative correlations of female authorship and employer prestige with p-hacking, where the latter is stronger in field versus top-tier journals. Implications of these findings, their limitations, and some suggestions going forward are discussed, with particular attention for the promise of preregistration and registered reports. © The Author(s) 2021.","family business research; meta-science; p-hacking; questionable research practices",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117578702

In fact, this is an interesting topic because it studies the importance of managing sustainability in tourism, which is a very wide industry in the world today. The social, economic and environmental impacts of tourism form a basis of discussion when it comes to the study of sustainability. In most countries, the impact of tourism on the social and economic aspects of the society is admirable (Alyusuf, 2019), an aspect that explains the reason behind increased investment in the sector. However, there are concerns over the impact of tourism on the environment. All these aspects have raised various debates, all of which are refutable. According to the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage (2017), Saudi Arabia is looking forward to nature-based sustainable tourism expecting 20 million tourists by 2020 (Scth, 2017). Attracting tourists through its beautiful marine environment and beaches is both advantageous and disadvantageous. The advantages are to bring business, invite foreign investors, increase population and bring employment to job seekers (RDC, 2020; NEOM, 2019). However, the disadvantages are economic problems, and environmental issues (Madkour, 2015; Mohamed, 2018; Farag, 2019).

After the Sino-US trade war, the United States’ resistance to my country’s communications technology has prompted China to become more independent and self-reliant, not only building a large number of 5G base stations in the country, but also helping other countries to complete the construction of 5G communication technology. 5G wireless technology is designed to give peak data speeds of at least 1Gbps, ultra-low latency, and reliable service to a wider audience. The more efficient and effective a business is, the more it's able to offer innovative user experiences and work with other businesses. Based on the combination of 5G and voice technology, this paper makes an innovative design for the core component of mobile communication-the antenna system. In the context of writing, this article adopts a traditional thesis structure, with relevant background introduction as a foreshadowing, to sort out and summarize relevant frontier theories at home and abroad. Next, it focuses on the current development of the key technologies of 5G communication system design. Subsequently, a millimeter-wave microstrip antenna was designed based on the characteristics of 5G communication, aiming to optimize the transmission performance of the antenna by selecting the substrate and designing the antenna structure. The experiment chose RogersRT/duroid 5880 as the substrate of the antenna. Its length is a common 24 mm, its width is three-quarters of its length, and its thickness is 0.48 mm. The dielectric constant εr is 2.2. The antenna of this structure was chosen because its value in terms of stability has been proven in practice, which can ensure the smoothness of signal transmission to a large extent. © 2021, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","5G technology; Antenna system; Mobile communication; Voice technology","Microstrip antennas; Millimeter waves; Antenna system; Communication antennas; Communicationtechnology; Data speed; Low latency; Mobile communications; Science and Technology; State resistance; Voice technologies; Wireless technologies; 5G mobile communication systems",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117196352

However, these opinions exclude language and linguistics which are the foundations for any knowledge. Meaning remains pivotal and fundamental in issues of language and communication hence the need to situate a robust study in semantics. In the area of global business, periodic revisions made on the international commercial terms (INCOTERMS) lead to misconceptions, vagueness and misunderstanding of terms in international trade. Moreover, it appears that training in entrepreneur development studies in our higher education lacks sufficient modules of language studies; therefore, the need to examine the import of meaning in the knowledge economy. This situation justifies the need for this study. Data was elicited from concepts in certain sectors of global trade, where one hundred lexical items were presented to 20 graduate students and 30 undergraduate students in the Entrepreneurial Development Studies (EDS) class of Covenant University. The use of a questionnaire to elicit the respondents’ semantic understanding of key concepts in business enabled the use of qualitative and quantitative approaches of analysis.

The continued low business performance by SMTEs in Masvingo Province motivated the study. The marketing mix theory underpinned the study. The ten tourism marketing mix strategies, namely product, price, place, promotion, people, process, physical evidence, programming, packaging, and partnership were the strategy variables of the study. The study employed a quantitative research approach. An online structured questionnaire was used to collect data from all the 250 owners and managers of SMTEs. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 was used for the analysis of data. The main study findings were that SMTEs in Masvingo Province use all the ten tourism marketing mix strategies, albeit with varying degrees of application. The three most used strategies were product, packaging, and price. The three least used strategies were people, programming, and partnership. The moderately used strategies were physical evidence, promotion, place, and process. The value of this study relates to the use of a ten tourism marketing mix framework by SMTEs. Implications are that study organisations may not reach full performance potential due to unequal use of the ten tourism marketing mix strategy elements. © 2020.

The project builds upon a successful data-driven, research-led paid internship programme in the UK (Q-Step) which enables undergraduate social science students to practise data skills through immersion in the workplace. Two-hundred and fifty students have benefited from the Q-Step programme in six years, many graduating into analytical careers in civic society and industry. EmpoderaData aims to build on this experiential learning initiative by developing a data fellowship programme in order to foster and develop data literacy skills in Latin America, led by the need to address society's most pressing issues and using the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). EmpoderaData Phase 1 explored whether the internship model would have relevance and usefulness within the context of three Latin American case study countries (Brazil, Colombia and Mexico). The team set out to establish a baseline of the state of data literacy and existing training programs in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. As part of a 'Big Data for the Common Good' event, a workshop was held in São Paulo with thirty participants representing data literacy advocacy or policy formation and drawn from civil society, academia, the private and public sector. The main conclusions from this first phase are: (1) the most requested data literacy training need is for basic skills, including introductory statistics, foundation data analysis and methodological skills; (2) paid data fellowship models are acknowledged as a useful intervention; and (3) the notion of a 'hybrid' professional to build data literacy capacities for 'social science' purposes provides a practical way forward. In the EmpoderaData Phase 2 project our focus was on Colombia to explore the challenges and opportunities of developing a pilot data fellowship model there. Engaging with national, regional and international capacity development efforts, this highlighted a demand for partnerships between universities and organisations working on the social challenges represented by the SDGs. Partnerships ensure that the in-country data literacy pipeline is strengthened in a home-grown, self-sustaining way, producing a steady flow of data literate graduates into the institutions and sectors where critical data skills are most needed. We report on how the EmpoderaData project is exploring working with students studying Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) degrees at the Universidad del Rosario, to improve the application of statistical methods to the social sciences. The aim is to strengthen STEM skills and develop youth empowerment across Colombia, urban and rural areas, to improve the quality of statistical education at the national level, and support the skills needed to deliver the SDGs. In parallel, the Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV) Business School in São Paulo agreed to trial the work-placement programme in their undergraduate business and public policy degrees through a programme entitled 'The FGV Q-Step Center to improve quantitative skills in undergraduate business students'. This two-year-long funded study will enable us to explore the transferability of the internship model from the UK to Brazil. The paper will discuss how the programme was established (following the lessons learned from EmpoderaData), explain how this model will be implemented in FGV, especially paying attention to how the curriculum will develop to support it, and how the impact of the programme will be monitored. The knowledge exchange generated from this study will complement the research conducted through the EmpoderaData project. The paper will cover the progress of the EmpoderaData project and FGV-Q-Step Center to date and explore how we are developing these initiatives, the challenges we have faced, and how through partnership working we are developing capacity building in statistical and data skills training. © 2021 - The authors.

The skills and competencies required to automate, analyse, and optimize such complex systems are often not part of the traditional skill set of most National Statistical Offices. The adoption of these technologies requires new knowledge, methodologies and the upgrading of the quality assurance framework, technology, security, privacy, and legal matters. However, there are methodological challenges and discussions among scholars about the diverse methodical confinement and the wide array of skills and competencies considered relevant for those working with big data at NSOs. This paper develops a Data Science Model for Official Statistics (DSMOS), graphically summarizing the role of data science in statistical business processes. The model combines data science, existing scientific paradigms, and trusted smart statistics, and develops around a restricted number of constructs. We considered a combination of statistical engineering, data engineering, data analysis, software engineering and soft skills such as statistical thinking, statistical literacy and specific knowledge of official statistics and dissemination of official statistics products as key requirements of data science in official statistics. We then analyse and discuss the educational requirements of the proposed model, clarifying their contribution, interactions, and current and future importance in official statistics. The DSMOS was validated through a quantitative method, using a survey addressed to experts working at the European statistical systems. The empirical results show that the core competencies considered relevant for the DSMOS include acquisition and processing capabilities related to Statistics, high-frequency data, spatial data, Big Data, and microdata/nano-data, in addition to problem-solving skills, Spatio-temporal modelling, machine learning, programming with R and SAS software, Data visualisation using novel technologies, Data and statistical literacy, Ethics in Official Statistics, New data methodologies, New data quality tools, standards and frameworks for official statistics.

Student enrollment projections are particularly important, since they affect institutions’ income, the number of faculty needed, facility requirements, budgets, etc. There are overviews of forecasting and classifications in general and for particular methods and applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, the last overview of forecasting in HE was published in 1997. Since then, two major approaches sipped from business to HE and became dominant in HE forecasting: data mining and questionnaires for marketing. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an updated overview of forecasting methods used in HE and their main areas of application. We cover a large array of forecasting methods and areas of HE application, we classify them, and point at examples from the literature, rather than providing an exhaustive annotated review, since there are too many publications in the literature on forecasting in HE. Counting the number of articles published in the Web of Science during the last 20 years, we find that, out of six main forecasting methods identified and classified, four methods are used most often in HE: regression, simulation, data mining (including its sub-methods), and questionnaires. Furthermore, four areas of application for forecasting are used most often in HE: enrollment, marketing, teaching, and performance. The two relatively new forecasting methods used in HE, during the last 20 years, are data mining and questionnaires. These two, relatively new forecasting methods, educational data mining and questionnaires (for marketing), are classified in this chapter as active forecasting methods in HE, as they provide the administrator with control over the forecast by pointing (directly or indirectly) at actions which can achieve a better-targeted forecast. While the old methods, time series, and ratio methods, are classified as passive methods with no control. Though regression and simulation forecasting methods are often active, they can sometimes be passive. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Active forecast; Data mining; Forecasting; Higher education; Marketing; Planning; Prediction; Regression; Simulation; Time series",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114989780

We extract organisational actors from the full text of business and news articles, link co-occurring actors in social networks, and use modularity partitioning to detect communities in these networks. Our results show that the focal agri-food firms vary in their ecosystem associations, with little duplication in the actor organisations across the different firms’ networks.

Constructs from the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model and an added variable, perceived risk (PR), are examined to predict BI. Age and gender as moderators are retained in this model. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was used to gather the respondents’ responses on a five-point Likert scale. G * Power was used to calculate the required minimum sample size. A non-probability sampling technique was used to gather data from the 290 respondents based in Malaysia. The final data set was analyzed using the statistical package for the social sciences and SmartPLS software using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results show that three of the five proposed factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy and facilitating condition) are significant predictors of BI to adopt cryptocurrency as a medium of transaction. Interestingly, PR is not a significant predictor even though prior research studies showed otherwise. Likewise, the relationship between BI and social influence became significant only when age is added as a moderator. Practical implications: Malaysians are still wary of cryptocurrency, even though global tech firms such as Amazon and Microsoft are already accepting Bitcoin as a payment method. This study aims to provide relevant authorities and businesses (i.e. central bank, retail merchants and cryptocurrency exchangers) insights toward understanding the factors consumers focus on if they were to use cryptocurrency as a medium of transaction. Originality/value: Most cryptocurrency research are done in developed countries (i.e. USA, UK and EU) perspective. This research addresses the lack of quantitative literature on significant factors influencing BI to use cryptocurrency in developing country context while taking a PR, age and gender into consideration. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behavioral intention; Cryptocurrency; Malaysia; Medium of transaction; Performance expectancy; UTAUT",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113900670

Applications of machine learning in speech recognition (e.g., Alexa and Siri), image recognition, automated translation, autonomous driving, and medical diagnosis, have blurred the classical divide between human tasks and machine tasks. Although current Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies outperform humans in many areas, tasks requiring common sense, contextual knowledge, creativity, adaptivity, and empathy are still best performed by humans. Hybrid Intelligence (HI) blends human intelligence and machine intelligence to combine the best of both worlds. Hence, current and future Business Process Management (BPM) initiatives need to consider HI and the changing boundaries between work done by people and work done by software robots. Consider, for example, the success of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which demonstrates that gradually taking away repetitive tasks from workers is possible. In this viewpoint paper, we argue that process mining is a key technology to decide what to automate and what not. Moreover, using process mining, it is possible to systematically monitor and manage processes where work is distributed over human workers and software robots. © 2021, SciKA.","Business process management; Data science; Hybrid intelligence; Machine learning; Process science",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113291577

A quantitative methodology is used for data collection based on 110 incubatee start-up firms from 8 incubators in Uganda. It is a cross-sectional descriptive study, which investigates the causal effect of variables at a definite point in time. A principal factor analysis was conducted to single out the particular constructs of business incubation practices and sustainability. Simple random sampling was used for selecting start-ups from the incubation centres. The sampling framework consists of the founders of the start-ups that have been previously incubated at any of the selected incubation centres. Data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Incubatee selection criteria, incubatee monitoring practices and resources have a positive and significant impact on sustainability of incubatee start-up firms. The study has emphasised good business incubation practices to enable sustainability of start-up firms in Uganda.

Application of large storage technology, data mining and analysis is a research direction with practical needs when testing on IoT data sets. Deciding which tool to choose depends on the nature of work. One of the ways to evaluate the system towards data is to conduct the test in environment which the database will run, under the predicted data and the user’s current workload. This paper comparatively studies on performance of opensource databases presenting in Internet of Things (IoT) systems such as NoSQL database-based MongoDB and SQL database-based PostgreSQL. Data stored in the database will be exploited, processed, and analyzed. Mining and analyzing data are one of the key parts in the data science. Data science is an interdisciplinary field of study that encompasses processes and systems for extracting knowledge within data in various structured and unstructured forms. Data science includes many areas of data analysis such as statistics, machine learning, data mining, predictive analysis. To provide the necessary rationale for the plans, it is to build a predictive model. Without predictive analytical tools we would be overwhelmed with data without information, not knowing what happened next. Based on the content, method and purpose of the forecast is divided into two categories: qualitative methods and quantitative methods. Qualitative methods often depend heavily on the experience of one or more experts in the relevant field. Quantitative method uses historical data over time, based on historical data to detect the movement direction of the object that is suitable for a certain mathematical model and at the same time use that model as estimation.

This research method is an integrated system and offers the opportunity for a holistic view that combines data collection methods such as archival searches, interviews, questionnaires and observation. The data collection needed to build a case study is labour-intensive, can last months or even years, and data overload seems almost inevitable. The case study is an empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon within a real-life context. In this research method, qualitative data usually predominates, but quantitative data often appears in case studies. Some research studies consider the case study to be a research method for validating and constructing theory. Other research highlights that all social science studies must start with a theory based on a review of the literature relating to the subject under investigation and this theory must then be validated through the study of a specific object, phenomenon or social problem. The key point is that before a theory can be validated, it must be constructed. In other words, a theory or theoretical framework first emerges not through a deductive process but through the inductive approach of studying an empirical case or object, and finally all theories are initially based on a case or object. This type of research has traditionally been considered soft, due to the inexistence of criteria that allow to evaluate its validity as a method to study a phenomenon in its real context. The present work is part of this theme and intends to contribute to diminish the perception about the lack of rigour associated with the case study. The present research focuses on the analysis of the methodological rigour of defended master’s dissertations. In this context an investigation was undertaken of master’s dissertations in the management area of a higher education management institution that use the case study as the research method. In order to achieve our goals, four hundred and forty-two master’s dissertations defended in management scientific master’s degrees in a Portuguese higher education institution which specializes in the area of economic and business sciences were analysed. The results of the qualitative research indicate that 40.0% of the dissertations focus on case studies. The results obtained lead us to conclude that in general the dissertations analysed present a high level of methodological rigour with respect to the object of study and a moderate level with respect to data analysis and results. The most critical aspects are the way data are collected, namely the use of multiple sources of evidence in less than half of the cases, which makes triangulation of data impossible. © 2021.

However, the popularity of waqf declined in recent years. It is essential to understand the past research, the research gaps and the waqf’s ignorant research areas within the existing literature to enhance the waqf system. Therefore, this study aims to carry a detailed analysis of waqf research development with a careful evaluation of the scientific panorama’s different aspects inherent in Islamic business and social finance. Design/methodology/approach: Scientometrics is a discipline that studies the quantitative characteristics and characteristics of science and technological research, technology and innovation.

There is a growing need to model and guide the operations, not just in single companies but also on ecosystem level. To be able to do this, new and better tools are needed. This paper explores the ecosystems of organisations and presents the process for building an ecosystem profile. To understand ecosystems better, managers can utilise ecosystem profiles like criminal investigators utilise criminal profiles. Design science research is used to create the process, and the process steps utilise methods from web farming and social network analysis. The created process is tested with an illustrative case. The process and the profiles created with it can be used by both researchers and managers. The ecosystem profile makes sense of the complex structure and gives data-based insights into the ecosystem under review.

Adding to these debates, the present volume assembles studies that explore a variety of empirical settings, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging that there are multiple “Worlds of Rankings.” To this end, the first part of the chapter addresses the implications of two modes of criticism that characterize much of the scholarly work on rankings and summarizes extant conceptual debates. Taking stock of what we know, the second part distinguishes three areas of empirical research. The first area concerns the activities of those who produce rankings, such as the collection of data or different business strategies. Studies in the second area focus on inter-organizational, field-level, or discursive phenomena, particularly how rankings are received, interpreted, and institutionalized. The third area covers the manifold effects that research has unveiled, ranging from the diffusion of practices and changes in organizational identities to emotional distress. Taken together, the contributions to this volume expand our knowledge in all three areas, inviting new debates and suggesting pathways forward. © 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","Comparisons; Effects; Fields; Institutionalization; Quantification; Rankings",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109370351

In the business landscape, its effects may be more detrimental to micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) because they tend to have limited financial and human resources to manage the challenges caused by COVID-19. To help MSMEs enhance their resilience, this paper aims to discuss how they can leverage mass collaboration to build social media-based knowledge ecosystems to manage interactions among internal and external stakeholders for knowledge creation and innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The paper proposes a model for MSMEs to build an online knowledge ecosystem and a standalone text analytics tool to use the advanced data analytics, e.g. topic modeling, to analyze and aggregate collective insights. Design science research methodology is used to develop the model and the tool. Findings: Through mass collaboration using social media and advanced data analytics technology, MSMEs can generate new business ideas, leading to enhanced resilience to meet the challenges caused by COVID-19 or other unexpected or extraordinary circumstances, such as natural disasters and financial crises. Originality/value: To the best of authors’ knowledge, this paper is one of the first papers in social media adoption for knowledge creation and innovation research, providing detailed approaches for MSMEs to build a knowledge ecosystem on social media and to use advanced data analytics to mine the meaning of the generated data. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business resilience; COVID-19; Data analytics; Knowledge ecosystem; Mass collaboration; MSMEs; Social media",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109341648

Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory mixed method approach was employed. Survey data provided the quantitative information that was analysed using statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS). Interviews of 1.5–2 h duration were conducted to gather the qualitative data. The study utilised an inductive thematic approach to analyse these data. Findings: Employers were resolute in the view that despite the high level of youth unemployment in Palestine, they still had difficulty in sourcing suitably qualified graduates. Collaboration between employers and higher education providers is not of a level that supports the development of graduateness. The identified key skill shortages occurred in the soft skills area, for example, written and verbal communication, language and problem-solving skills, negotiation and conflict resolution. Research limitations/implications: As an exploratory research study, there are opportunities for future research investigating more deeply the themes identified and the success or otherwise of the recommended initiatives. Practical implications: This study has implications for both educationalists and policymakers, regarding the prioritisation of development funding and of policies and practices aimed at improving youth employment. There are implications for all stakeholders with regard to collaboration in curriculum development, provision of education, and training and development programmes targeting young people to ensure that they are work ready.

Moreover, after pointing at the potentially destructive consequences of innovations, the creativity consequences analytical framework (Kampylis & Valtanen 2010) is introduced. On this base, we are assessing the intentions behind and expected consequences of entrepreneurial activity in the Norwegian nature-based tourism sector. Findings gained from data of a nation-wide survey in 2017 reveal that the sector is dominated by life-style entrepreneurs characterized by motives and creative practices grounded on a fruitful combination of human and business-centred goals and a responsible use of local resources.

The purpose of this paper is to study: the nature and magnitude of outsourcing of health-care services in a Smart City of Eastern India; the motives behind outsourcing: and the factors affecting outsourcing decisions. Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted in Bhubaneswar, a Smart City of Eastern India and capital of Odisha State. Data relating to the outsourcing of health-care services were collected from 40 hospitals (each having a minimum of 10 beds) through a structured schedule. Descriptive statistics were calculated through Statistical Package for Social Science to substantiate the objectives. Findings: Most of the clinical services were outsourced by small hospitals, while a significant portion of non-clinical services were outsourced by large and medium hospitals. Reduction in cost and better management control were the major driving forces of outsourcing. Loss of control over service providers and quality of measurement were considered as the main disadvantages in the decision-making process of not outsourcing the services by hospitals.

Design/methodology/approach: The author tests the two modes of innovation using data from 159 young firms in China. Findings: The author’s analysis indicates that a higher level of DUI innovation mode is more relevant to the innovation performance of newly established enterprises. Moreover, the effectiveness of the innovation mode is bound by the networks in which the company operates and interacts. The effectiveness of STI and DUI innovation modes is enhanced when there are high levels of innovation and business network interconnectedness from the technology network partner. Research limitations/implications: These findings have important implications on innovation research as they highlight the joint effects of innovation modes and quality of network ties on young firms seeking to improve their innovation performance. Practical implications: STI and DUI innovation modes represent different forms of innovation activities that may affect the knowledge and resources of young firms used to improve innovation performance. Knowing this can help young firms to choose effective innovation mode. Originality/value: This study makes three contributions. The first is to pay specific attention to the neglected topic of the influence of STI and DUI innovation modes on innovation performance of young firms. Understanding that the two innovation modes offer different methods of gaining knowledge and resources can help young firms choose an effective innovation mode for their business; Second, the author examines the boundary conditions of the effectiveness of innovation modes. Specially, the author examines the moderating role of external networks, which can help clarify conflicting results in this regard. 10;The third contribution is to investigate the importance of network relationships for innovation activities moving beyond the extent of network relationships to instead consider the ability of those relationships to expose a firm to innovative techniques and methods. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","DUI; Innovation mode; Innovation performance; STI",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106292080

The development of these skills should therefore be included in business school curricula. The ability to critically reflect has been identified as a crucial part of employability. This calls for developing pedagogical approaches that will stimulate students’ critical thinking skills, encourage self-review as well as convey practice realities. This paper presents an application of such pedagogical methods applied in a set of course activities aimed specifically at developing reflexivity and self-efficacy of undergraduate business students, within the context of a university of applied sciences. It also demonstrates that the pedagogical solutions applied not only resulted in the desired learning outcomes, but also produced additional benefits to the students. A pedagogical approach was created and incorporated into one semester International Business Communication course taught to undergraduate international business students. It aimed at developing critical thinking skills, and reflexivity. It was incorporated in three activities: (1) introducing the students to the concept of reflexivity (reflecting on reflection), (2) writing reflectively about own cultural identity (reflection in action), (3) story writing and storytelling (reflecting on action). The methodological approach used was qualitative interpretation, and the method applied was narrative analysis of the data generated by reflective narratives created by the students. The findings showed that reflexivity was identified as a new concept, both necessary and helpful in self-development. Reflecting on one’s own cultural identity created different types of awareness, which contributed to developing deeper knowledge about one’s own cultural identity. Reflecting on story writing and storytelling showed the following learning benefits: discovering creative potential, as well as developing confidence in dealing with new, unexpected, and challenging situations. Moreover, the following additional learning benefits were identified: enhanced openness towards the immediate environment, improved understanding of otherness, and the applicability of the above skills for business professionals and researchers. © ACPIL","professional skills; qualitative research skills; Reflexivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104779124

This sentiment describes the importance of cultural diversity in organisations. However, cultural diversity phenomenon has not been given serious attention by business. Research purpose: This study examines the perception on the influence of cultural diversity on business performance in automotive component manufacturers in South Africa. Motivation for the study: Cultural diversity in the organisation has grown over the passage of time with an increase in globalisation. People no longer live in an insular environment. They are part of the worldwide economy competing within a global framework. Hence, cultural diversity becomes a way of creating competitive advantage. Research design, approach and methods: The study was quantitative in design, with middle-level managers in two large automotive component manufacturers in the eThekwini District Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal participating in the study. Of the 168 individuals identified for participation, 118 participated in the study, representing a 70.2% response rate. Descriptive, correlative and t-tests, using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) were used to analyse the data. Main findings: Study results indicates that a culturally diverse workforce is associated with greater organisational performance, improved strategic decision-making and innovation. Hence, organisations must manage cultural diversity among their workforce for the improvement of business performance. Managerial implications: Culturally diverse workforce are associated with greater organisational performance, improved strategic decision-making and innovation. Hence, management must develop an understanding of their cultural settings if their organisations are to perform effectively. Contribution: The original value of this study is its approach in uncovering the strengths and weaknesses of cultural diversity on business performance in South Africa. © 2021. The Authors.

The purpose of the paper was also to find out if young consumers are currently concerned that a proper level of food safety is not ensured. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis was based on a data set from 650 questionnaires collected in an online survey carried out in October 2020 and addressed to the group of young consumers, students of Warsaw University of Life Sciences, Poland. The analysis was carried out using standard methods of qualitative data analysis (QDA), descriptive statistics, Spearman’s correlation coefficient and Pearson’s chi-square test. Findings: Less than a half of Polish young consumers consider food to be safe and many other do not have an opinion about this matter. Young consumers do not perceive official agencies in charge of food control as the most responsible for food safety, and they either do not trust these institutions or have no opinion about it. Young consumers declare that food producers and food processing businesses are the most responsible for food safety while retailers and consumers are the least responsible ones. The majority of young consumers are not concerned about ensuring proper food safety. Originality/value: Up-to-date young consumers' perception of the role and trust in official food control agencies and food safety in Poland have not been investigated, which makes this study a novelty. The findings can be valuable to official agencies in charge of food control and consumer education, to improve their functioning. They can also be important as a basis for further studies, as young consumers’ attitudes and trust in official food control agencies can change. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Food safety; Official food control agencies; Trust; Young consumers","article; attitude; biomedicine; catering service; consumer; correlation coefficient; data analysis; education; food processing; food safety; human; human experiment; perception; Poland; Polish citizen; questionnaire; trust",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102197675

However, conducting interviews can be a difficult procedure and requires specific skills. The current ways of teaching interview skills have significant deficiencies. They especially lack guidance and opportunities to practice. Objective: The goal of this work is to develop and validate a workshop format to teach interview skills for conducting good customer interviews in a practical manner. Method: The research method is based on design science research which serves as a framework. A game-based workshop format was designed to teach interview skills. The approach consists of a half-day, hands-on workshop and is based on an analysis of necessary interview skills. The approach has been validated in several workshops and improved based on learnings from those workshops. Results: Results of the validation show that participants could significantly improve their interview skills while enjoying the game-based exercises. The game-based learning approach supports learning and practicing customer interview skills with playful and interactive elements that encourage greater motivation among participants to conduct interviews. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Business agility; Customer development; Customer interviews; Educational games; Game-based learning; Lean startup; Product management","Data processing; Business idea; Customer problems; Design-science researches; Game-Based; Game-based Learning; Interactive elements; Interview skills; research methods; Sales",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101361868

Nowadays it is a well-documented psychological construct and a proven therapeutic technique, particularly in stress reduction and depressive relapse prevention. However, mindfulness and its effects on management practices are still relatively unexplored in the literature. OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to address this shortage and demonstrate the claims that mindfulness is a psychological construct that is doubly beneficial to business executives by supporting a more balanced relationship to work while promoting the adoption of more positive and effective leadership behaviors (transformational leadership and authentic). METHOD: A model using positive forms of leadership as mediators of mindfulness / performance relationship is proposed for this assessment. A quantitate analysis is performed on a sample of 319 African managers, 95% of which are South Africans. RESULTS: The data supports the idea that mindfulness is a resource that can be mobilized for inducing transformational and authentic leadership development and positive organizational behaviors. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness seems to be a very interesting predictor of transformational and authentic leadership styles, which prove to be the most powerful generators of performance. © 2021 - IOS Press.

This disruption brings a whole list of opportunities and challenges for organizations and the domain of supply chain management. Given big data availability, data analytics is needed to convert data into meaningful information, which plays an important role in supply chain management. One of the disruptive data analytics techniques that are predicted to impact growth, employment, and inequality in the market is automation of knowledge work, better known as machine learning. In this paper, we focused on comprehensively overviewing machine learning applications in demand forecasting and underlying its potential role in improving the supply chain efficiency. A total of 1870 papers were retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science databases based on our string query related to machine learning. A reduced total of 79 papers focusing on demand forecasting were comprehensively reviewed and used for the analysis in this study. The result showed that neural networks, artificial neural networks, support vector regression, and support vector machine were among the most widely used algorithms in demand forecasting with 27%, 22%, 18%, and 10%, respectively. This accounted for 77% of the total reviewed articles. Most of the machine learning application (65%) was applied in the industry sector, and a limited number of articles (5%) discussed the agriculture sector. This paper's practical implication is in exposing the current machine learning issues in the industry to help stakeholders and decision-makers better plan transformation actions. © 2021 Operations and Supply Chain Management Forum.

However, when no ground truth information is available on experts’ decisions, the evaluation of expert workers typically requires enlisting peer-experts, and this form of evaluation is prohibitively costly in many important settings. In this work, we develop a data-driven approach for producing effective rankings based on the decision quality of expert workers; our approach leverages historical data on past decisions, which are commonly available in organizational information systems. Specifically, we first formulate a new business data science problem: Ranking Expert decision makers’ unobserved decision Quality (REQ) using only historical decision data and excluding evaluation by peer experts. The REQ problem is challenging because the correct decisions in our settings are unknown (unobserved) and because some of the information used by decision makers might not be available for retrospective evaluation. To address the REQ problem, we develop a machine-learning–based approach and analytically and empirically explore conditions under which our approach is advantageous. Our empirical results over diverse settings and datasets show that our method yields robust performance: Its rankings of expert workers are consistently either superior or at least comparable to those obtained by the best alternative approach. Accordingly, our method constitutes a de facto benchmark for future research on the REQ problem. © 2020 Production and Operations Management Society","data science; decision quality evaluation; label accuracy; machine learning; worker ranking",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096681210

The consumer-centric design (putting the consumers at the centre of the content development and production) focuses on ways in which businesses can design customized services and products which accurately reflect consumer preferences. We propose a new framework which allows to use data science to optimize content-generation in entertainment and test this framework for the motion picture industry. We use the natural language processing methodology combined with econometric analysis to explore whether and to what extent emotions shape consumer preferences for media and entertainment content, which, in turn, affect revenue streams. By analyzing 6,174 movie scripts, we generate the emotional trajectory of each motion picture. We then combine the obtained mappings into clusters which represent groupings of consumer emotional journeys. These clusters are then plugged into an econometric model to predict overall success parameters of the movies including box office revenues, viewer satisfaction levels (captured by IMDb ratings), awards, as well as the number of viewers’ and critics’ reviews. We find that emotional arcs in movies can be partitioned into 6 basic shapes. The highest box offices are associated with the Man in a Hole shape which is characterized by an emotional fall followed by an emotional rise. This U-shaped emotional arc results in financially successful movies irrespective of genre and production budget. Implications of this analysis for generating on-demand content and improving productivity in entertainment industries are discussed. © 2020 The Author(s).

Blockchain is a technology that provides such a data repository. However, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) assumed a centralized data repository, and it is commonly argued that blockchain technology is not usable. This paper aims to posit a framework for adopting a blockchain that follows the GDPR. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses the Levy and Ellis’ narrative review of literature methodology, which is based on constructivist theory posited by Lincoln and Guba. Using five information systems and computer science databases, the researchers searched for studies using the keywords GDPR and blockchain, using a forward and backward search technique. The search identified a corpus of 416 candidate studies, from which the researchers applied pre-established criteria to select 39 studies. The researchers mined this corpus for concepts, which they clustered into themes. Using the accepted computer science practice of privacy by design, the researchers combined the clustered themes into the paper’s posited framework. Findings: The paper posits a framework that provides architectural tactics for designing a blockchain that follows GDPR to enhance privacy. The framework explicitly addresses the challenges of GDPR compliance using the unimagined decentralized storage of personal data. The framework addresses the blockchain–GDPR tension by establishing trust between a business and its customers vis-à-vis storing customers’ data. The trust is established through blockchain’s capability of providing the customer with private keys and control over their data, e.g. processing and access. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides a framework that demonstrates that blockchain technology can be designed for use in GDPR compliant solutions. In using the framework, a blockchain-based solution provides the ability to audit and monitor privacy measures, demonstrates a legal justification for processing activities, incorporates a data privacy policy, provides a map for data processing and ensures security and privacy awareness among all actors. The research is limited to a focus on blockchain–GDPR compliance; however, future research is needed to investigate the use of the framework in specific domains. Practical implications: The paper posits a framework that identifies the strategies and tactics necessary for GDPR compliance. Practitioners need to compliment the framework with rigorous privacy risk management, i.e. conducting a privacy risk analysis, identifying strategies and tactics to address such risks and preparing a privacy impact assessment that enhances accountability and transparency of a blockchain. Originality/value: With the increasingly strategic use of data by businesses and the contravening growth of data privacy regulation, alternative technologies could provide businesses with a means to nurture trust with its customers regarding collected data.

In a time where we are only beginning to witness artificial intelligence’s disruption of work and the economy, these learning outcomes are crucial to personal and professional success. This paper begins by tracing the role of the Discussion Method within the liberal arts tradition, and by extension the Confucian tradition. Second, this paper examines how the Discussion Method lost its value in higher education as a consequence of the employability problem. In this section, the employability problem is defined as a two-fold misunderstanding among students and parents regarding the purpose of education and how to prepare for the workplace. Third, this paper reframes the purpose of the Discussion Method in an integrated curriculum for preparing students to achieve personal and professional success. Also, in the third section, student generated data serve as evidence to support the argument that (1) discussion-based classes are an important missing element in undergraduate management education and (2) discussion-based classes are superior to large lectures. This paper concludes that a discussion-based business pedagogy anchored by the liberal arts and sciences leads to eight major learning outcomes: (1) how to reconcile opposing arguments; (2) how to think on one’s own two feet; (3) how to formulate cohesive arguments to reach a consensus; (4) how to mitigate fear of sharing individual opinions by building relationship among classmates; (5) how to allow students to learn better by motivating them to prepare more for class; (6) how to enable students to remain engaged during and after class; (7) how to embraces nuance; and (8) how to integrate new ideas from disparate perspectives and disciplines. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Business education; Discussion-based learning; Integrated learning; Liberal arts",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124999345

However, with the advent of digital technologies, a new kind of product innovations gained importance: digital product and service innovations (DPI). As a consequence of their idiosyncratic characteristics, the usefulness and validity of existing product innovation management concepts cannot be transferred to the context of DPI without further ado. Accordingly, this study reinvestigates the role of IT-C in the specific context of DPI. Therefore, we begin with a differentiation of DPI from traditional, non-digital product innovation. Then, we propose that IT-C affect the performance of DPI projects via two paths. First, based on the notion that DPI rely on the use of innovative IT, we assume that IT-C directly impact DPI performance. Second, following prior research that has argued that the performance contribution of IT-C is mediated by other organizational intermediaries, we assume that IT-C also indirectly contribute to DPI performance through their positive influence on other organizational capabilities. One such organizational capability that mediates the influence of IT-C on DPI performance is a firm's DPI capabilities (DPI-C). DPI-C allow firms to deploy their digital resources for DPI purposes and, thus, are an important antecedent for DPI performance. To test our assumptions, we use partial least squares–structural equation modeling technique and analyze survey data collected from DPI projects across different industries in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Digital capabilities; Digital innovations; Digital products and services; Digital transformation; IT business value; IT capabilities; New product development; Resource-based view","Information science; Information systems; Digital products; Digital resources; Digital technologies; IT Capabilities; Organizational capabilities; Partial least square (PLS); Product innovation; Structural equation modeling techniques; Least squares approximations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096190523

This has triggered large-scale adoption across hospitals. However, whether all hospitals obtain a similar effect from their EHR implementations remains an important question because there are significant differences differences in characteristics of hospitals adopting these systems. To examine differences in effects across hospitals, we examine whether the impacts of EHR applications are contingent on work domains, by assessing performance effects across hospitals with varying administrative scale and clinical complexity. Because EHRs constitute a suite of applications with different functionalities, examining the effects of different sets of applications is challenging due to nonlinear interdependencies between applications. Therefore, we use an archetype approach, identifying synergistic EHR (EHRSYN) archetype as an ideal portfolio—a conceptual anchor for a hospital's EHR portfolio. We test contingencies by combining this technology archetype with the work domains—administrative scale and clinical complexity. We test our hypotheses using empirical data from 137 hospitals in California, hypothesizing the differences in effects of EHRs on financial, operational, and clinical performances across hospitals with different administrative scales (size) and clinical complexities (case-mix) of work. While hospitals gain the most by implementing a portfolio close to the EHRSYN archetype, our nuanced models reveal that the benefits of such portfolios increase for large hospitals and are greater for hospitals treating less complex cases. These findings underscore how variations in applications used and work domains demarcate boundaries related to the performance effects of EHRs. We present a detailed discussion of the theoretical contributions and practical implications of our findings. © 2020","Archetype; Business value of IT; Electronic health record; Healthcare information technology","Information science; Information systems; Clinical performance; Electronic health record; Empirical data; Healthcare services; Hospital performance; Large hospitals; Nonlinear interdependencies; Performance effect; Hospitals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095693937

Data science has influenced all business functions in an insurance organization to provide a distinct competitive advantage and push the industry towards the vision of ‘Insure Tech’. This case revolves around one such application of analytics in HDFC analytics dealing with championing the initiative for forecasting and analysis of Business Persistency. The persistency ratio is actually a fairly simple, yet very important metric that provides a snapshot of the health of the insurance industry. Considering the importance of this parameter, it became extremely important for HDFC Life to understand the factors behind persistency numbers and what lies ahead for the organization. The existing forecasting techniques were biased by the nature of work and did not give a significantly accurate and realistic number. The top management found this to be challenging for decision-making and decided that this required the intervention of the Business Insights department. Mr. Francis Rodrigues, SVP—Data Labs, Business Insights and Innovation was given the task to take over the pilot project and increase usage of analytical tools for Persistency Analysis. While Quarter 1 results have been significant, Mr. Francis Rodrigues still wonders whether he captured all the internal and external measures to obtain effective results. Has he done enough and how many more areas can analytics be applied for in the insurance domain? Research Question/Purpose: The current methods of persistency calculation are biased by the nature of work and deflect by a huge margin from the numbers actually achieved. There are no realistic forecasts for the coming year making the management uncertain with the decisions they take for strategic purposes. Theory: Time-indexed collection data help in predicting persistency numbers which are also influenced by some important variables behind collection follow-up and categories of customers. Type of the Case: Applied problem solving. Protagonist: Not needed. Options: Due to the availability of time-indexed data, time series was considered to be the best approach to forecast values into the future. However, that would only solve one half of the problem. It was also important to understand the parameters affecting persistency numbers, important variables behind persistency collections and classify the customers based on such variables. With this knowledge, classification models were also taken into consideration. Discussions and Case Questions: Besides time-indexed collection data which other variables amongst policy and demographic parameters influence persistency parameters? How can insights be drawn about the factors that are actually affecting the persistency numbers? Will calculating and sharing monthly persistency numbers for the coming year improve the percentage of customers remitting payment on time? By classifying customers into various categories with regards to the frequency of follow-up required for premium collection can a favourable segment be carved out? © 2020 SAGE Publications.","business insights; data analytics; financial analytics; Life insurance; marketing analytics; persistency; sales forecasting; time series analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094599463

Entrepreneurship is considered to be a combination of both art and science, used to create value when targeting customers; however, there appears to be a myth when it comes to the recipe required for success. It was discovered by The Office of Small and Medium Enterprise Promotion that less than 10% of Thai small and medium entrepreneurial businesses were successful, while the global rate of success is close to 5 times higher than that of Thailand. Therefore, a better understanding of key success factors is necessary going forward. Typically, an entrepreneur’s journey starts with entrepreneurial intention, opportunity recognition, business initiative creation, and resource assembly, if they are to start their venture successfully. Entrepreneurial intention is a prerequisite to entrepreneurial behavior, based on the theory of planned behavior. Subsequently, scholars are interested in the key factors which drive entrepreneurial intention. While innovativeness has been proven to be one of the critical factors within certain groups of the population, there is little empirical data on the causal relationship between innovativeness and entrepreneurial intention amongst undergraduate students. As such, this study has two main objectives: (1) to explore factors influencing innovativeness, attitudes towards entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial intentions of undergraduate students, and (2) to understand the causal relationship between innovativeness and entrepreneurial intentions among undergraduate students. The population of the study is comprised of undergraduate students from public universities and 330 effective responses were received in the survey. Based on the findings from confirmatory analysis and multiple regression, the empirical data is consistent with the theoretical measurement model for both innovativeness and entrepreneurial intention and (2) innovativeness can effectively predict entrepreneurial intention among undergraduate students. © 2020, The Author(s).","Entrepreneurial attitude; Entrepreneurial intentions; Innovativeness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090090917

Recent stringent UN and EU regulations promoting lower GWP refrigerants have been ratified to tackle the high carbon footprint of current refrigerants. This paper introduces a data-driven modelling framework for optimal investment strategies supporting the food retail industry to transition from hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigeration systems to lower GWP systems by 2030, in line with EU legislation. Representative data from a UK food retailer is applied in a mixed integer linear model, making simultaneous investment decisions across the property estate. The model considers refrigeration-system age, capacity, refrigerant type, leakage and past performance relative to peer systems in the rest of the estate. This study proposes two possible actions for high GWP HFC refrigeration systems: a) complying with legislation by retrofitting with an HFO blend (e.g. R449-A) or b) installing a new natural refrigerant system (e.g. R744). Findings indicate that a standard (i.e. business-as-usual) investment level of £6 m/yr drives a retrofitting strategy enabling significant reduction in annual carbon emissions of 71% by the end of 2030 (against the 2018 baseline), along with meeting regulatory compliance. The strategy is also highly effective at reducing emissions in the short term as total emissions during the 12-year programme are 59% lower than would have been experienced if the HFC emissions continued unabated. However, this spending level leaves the business at significant risk of refrigeration system failures as necessary investments in new systems are delayed resulting in an ageing, poorly performing estate. The model is further tested under different budget and policy scenarios and the financial, environmental, and business-risk implications are analysed. For example, under a more aggressive investment approach of £50 m/yr carbon reductions are at 93% by the end of 2030, whilst also ensuring compliance with the legislative cut-off four years early in 2026 and substantially enhancing the reliability of the refrigeration systems in the portfolio. Alternatively, when emissions are minimised instead of cost with a £50 m/yr investment level, 99% decarbonisation is achieved by 2030. Overall, the study highlights the trade-offs between capital investment and system resilience requiring a careful balance of priorities and the need to have up to date information so decision makers can reliably drive a successful strategy towards more sustainable operation of refrigeration systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Decarbonisation; Low-carbon roadmap; Mitigation; Refrigerants; Science based targets; Sustainability strategy","Budget control; Carbon footprint; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Global warming; Refrigerants; Refrigeration; Regulatory compliance; Retrofitting; Risk perception; Sales; Strategic planning; Data driven modelling; Global warming potential; Investment decisions; Mixed integer linear; Natural refrigerants; Refrigerant leakages; Refrigeration system; Sustainable operations; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088749993

Accordingly, all data and information are provided by original sources. Case overview/synopsis: Osmel “Ozzie” Delgado, MBA and COO of CCF was faced with a dilemma. Under the new CMS reimbursement formula, patient satisfaction survey scores directly impacted hospital reimbursement. However, the CCF patient satisfaction surveys revealed some very unhappy patients. Delgado pondered these results that really made no sense to him because CCF received the highest national and state rankings for its clinical quality at the same time. Clearly, patients were receiving the best medical care, but they were still unhappy.

Towards this goal, we customize technology roadmapping by synthesizing roadmapping, big data, data science, and data-driven organization literature. The resulting data science roadmapping approach links business strategy with data-related, technological, and organizational resources. It also enables communication, stakeholder buy-in, and project prioritization. While most of the existing studies illustrate prebuilt roadmaps, this study focuses on the process of roadmapping.

The study also examines the areas where the private education providers have not been accountable in their business models, decision-making and operations and thus suggests ways that the private education providers can collaborate with other stakeholders to bring about transformation and better educational outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: The positive image of the corporate, social and environmental performance of any organisation to a very large extent is critical to the success of the organization. To underscore the need for managers to be more responsive to the effect their business policies and operations have on the society, this study examined the managerial behaviour and corporate social responsibility (CSR) of private education providers in Nigeria, especially at the primary level – the foundation of the educational system all over the world. The study adopted a mixed method for data collection, involving a survey and focus group discussion. Simple random sampling and purposive sampling were used, respectively, to select the final sample size of respondents made up of stakeholders of private schools – parents, teachers, school proprietors and officials of the Ministry of Education. The multiple regression procedure on Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 20 was used to analyse data from the survey, whereas ethnographic content analysis was used to analyse data from focus group discussion. While it is evident that most parents and guardian in the global community are choosing the private schools over the public schools because of their perceived accountability or social responsibility that ensures academic success, findings from the study of private schools, especially in the developing countries show that some private education providers fall short in responsible managerial behaviour and corporate responsibility. Socially responsible managerial behaviour has been found to be a deliberate choice which business-savvy managers make and use to gain competitive advantage and secure their businesses. Findings: Based on the hypothesis testing, the calculated value of the independent variable on the dependent variable is significant because the probability is less than 0.05 (p < 0.05). The variables under consideration – the obligation to deliver quality education (independent variable) correlated significantly with the dependent variable, the establishment of private schools. Thus, the finding shows that the obligation to deliver quality education and services led to the establishment of private schools. Also, results from the focus group discussion show that the motivation for establishing a school for some private school operators is basically borne out of the need to make a positive impact on society by bringing about positive changes in the educational system. Research limitations/implications: A major limitation of the study is the dearth of literature in this area of study – corporate social responsibility in private school. There is a dearth of research in this area because of the perception that private schools or educational entrepreneurs are exploitative (Mars and Ginter, 2012; Paul, 2012). Hence, the study adopted an exploratory approach. Practical implications: The practical implication of the study borders on the need for private school managers and operators to collaborate with stakeholder groups – parents, teachers, the government and its regulatory body – the Ministry of Education for better educational outcomes. Social implications: The social implication of the study is the need for managers and operators of private schools to deliver cost-effective education so that it can be fairly accessible to a higher percentage of the populace of pupils rather than just a privileged few. This will go a long a to reducing the social inequality among pupils, as a greater population of pupils in Nigeria and many other developing countries are in dilapidated public schools where little or no teaching and learning activities take place. Originality/value: This study makes an original contribution to the literature on managerial behaviour and CSR as a strategy for making a positive impact on the stakeholders of an organization/institution as the case may be, increasing business performance and having a competitive advantage. Managerial behaviour and CSR in educational institutions, especially private educational institutions is an area that is scarcely studied and thus, there is a dearth of literature in this area (Mars and Ginter, 2012; Paul, 2012). The present study focuses on managerial behaviour of private primary education providers and operators and this because all over the world, the primary education is the basic and the most vulnerable of all the levels in the educational system. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibilities; Managerial behaviour; Nigeria; Primary education; Private education providers",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118135510

Regulatory technology actually includes two aspects of 'compliance' and 'supervision', which can help financial institutions to reduce compliance costs and enhance compliance with internal control; Regulatory technology can also help regulatory agencies to enhance regulatory efficiency and reduce regulatory pressure. The essence is to use science and technology as an important path to achieve supervision. How to correctly apply regulatory technology to better improve the level of risk monitoring in the Internet finance field has become an urgent problem for financial regulatory authorities and industry self-regulatory organizations in various countries and regions to solve. Combined with logit model thinking, the construction concept of regulatory science and technology should at least include four dimensions: macro policy, business attributes, data modeling and technical path. It is recommended to improve the theoretical framework of supervisory technology and the study of its supervisory path, promote the construction of supervisory technology standards, expand the application of supervisory technology achievements, and effectively improve the level of risk monitoring in Internet finance. © 2020 IEEE.","compliance technology; Internet finance; logit model; monitoring concept; regulatory technology; risk monitoring","Compliance control; Data handling; Finance; Logistic regression; Financial institution; Regulatory agencies; Regulatory authorities; Regulatory organizations; Regulatory pressure; Science and Technology; Technology standards; Theoretical framework; Regulatory compliance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107630266

Simultaneously, building operators could nowadays be empowered with information and communication technology that dynamically integrates relevant information sources, predicts future electricity prices and demand, and uses smart control to enable electricity cost savings. In particular, data-driven decision support systems would allow the utilization of temporal flexibilities in electricity consumption by shifting load to times of lower electricity prices. To contribute to this development, we propose a simple, general, and forward-looking demand response (DR) approach that can be part of future data-driven decision support systems in the domain of building electricity management. For the special use case of building air conditioning systems, our DR approach decides in periodic increments whether to exercise air conditioning in regard to future electricity prices and demand. The decision is made based on an ex-ante estimation by comparing the total expected electricity costs for all possible activation periods. For the prediction of future electricity prices, we draw on existing work and refine a prediction method for our purpose. To determine future electricity demand, we analyze historical data and derive data-driven dependencies. We embed the DR approach into a four-step framework and demonstrate its validity, utility and quality within an evaluation using real-world data from two public buildings in the US. Thereby, we address a real-world business case and find significant cost savings potential when using our DR approach. © 2020, The Author(s).","Data-driven decision support; Demand response in electricity markets; Design science research; Information and communication technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090313539

AI tools and techniques, such as machine learning, data mining, neural networks, and advanced analytics, are evolving at a high speed, creating a consistent need for updated research. This is especially relevant with frequent developments for the application of AI technology in many science and industry sectors. This rapid expansion created a need for research that focuses on the questions surrounding the development of AI such as ethical issues, responsible AI methods and applications, and its widespread implementation. Within the answers to these questions is the prevailing notion that AI should be accountable, explainable, transparent, and fair for all organizations and individuals. Responsible AI and Ethical Issues for Businesses and Governments widens the understanding of AI outside of the ""narrow"" technical perspective to a broader viewpoint that embraces the links between AI theory, practice, and policy. The chapters in this book discuss the basic philosophical and conceptual foundations of AI and explores the responsible application of AI tools and methods, the moral aspects of AI, practical issues, and responsible AI implementation across a range of industries. While highlighting topics that include digital transformation, ethical competence, information literacy in AI, and the interaction between AI and humans, this book is ideally designed for IT specialists, technology developers, technologists, ethicists, practitioners, stakeholders, academicians, students, and researchers who are interested in learning more about the ethical and responsible use of AI. © 2021 by IGI Global.

The findings of a multi-step exploratory study indicate that SME have an established mindset (dominant logic) that often hinders these firms from turning data in innovative products, services, and business models. The availability of large amounts of data and the use of this data through data science-driven practices has reached a stage when it now enables new and promising possibilities for firms to innovate. However, the actual use of data and data science insights has proven to be difficult for many companies. The firms under consideration in this paper recognize that the availability of data fundamentally changes their businesses. But also, they lack the appropriate culture, mindset, and business repertoire that would enable them to act by turning data into innovation. The paper concludes that firms first need to establish a new mindset in which data plays a central role. Here I term this mindset “data-dominant logic” (DDL).

This allows a comparison between the intended behavior represented by the model and the actual behavior captured by the log and is useful for many applications such as auditing. Existing approaches calculate conformance as follows: each deviation between model and log is corrected by an alignment, e.g., inserting a missing event to the log, that has a standard per-deviation cost of 1. While deviations in the model can be handled this way, there is no way to differentiate between intended (e.g., ad-hoc repair of instances) and unintended (e.g., security breaches) deviations. Hence this work proposes an advanced cost function, that allows for per-deviation adjustments of the per-deviation costs. By inspecting how the data elements of subsequent tasks are affected, it becomes possible to automatically increase or decrease the per-deviation costs of 1, thus allowing for an automatic classification of deviation causes. The proposed approach works offline and online (i.e., at runtime) and is evaluated based on a real-world dataset from the manufacturing domain. © 2020 IEEE.","Data-driven Alignment Costs; Logging Errors; Online Conformance Checking; Process mining and business analytics","Computer programming; Computer science; Automatic classification; Conformance checking; Data driven; Data elements; Manufacturing domains; Process Modeling; Real-world; Security breaches; Cost functions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096553560

This analysis refers to the strand of literature on STI (Science and Technology-based Innovation) and DUI innovation modes (Innovation based on learning-by-Doing, learning-by-Using, learning-by-Interacting) that have been intensely debated over the past few years. It is a relevant area of research because it discusses the most effective innovation mode adopted by firms and their regions in the context of increasing global competition. In this scientific area, we inquire whether and how the regional context and its specific technological capabilities produce a differentiated impact of STI and DUI innovation modes on innovation outputs, alongside the nature of innovation outputs. In this respect, this study advances the literature on regional innovation systems that have not been analyzed by other scholarly contributions in this strand who have mostly discussed the differentiated impact of innovation modes across individual countries, industries, and business networks. Based on the large heterogeneity of regions across the European geography, we move beyond the set of individual country studies and develop a thorough analysis based on the Community Innovation Survey (CIS 2014) data from the Eurostat office about EU regions. Empirical evidence based on the application of a multiple treatment model suggests that both regional specificities and the nature of innovation matter.

CPS, one of Industry 4.0's key technologies, can be applied in many areas including health, mobility, production and logistics. The partial or total incorporation of CPS technologies into internal logistics equipment can present such advantages to businesses as reductions in logistics operational costs and in production cycle times. Although this application is still under development, several manufacturers already offer to the market internal logistics equipment incorporating CPS technologies, presenting them as fully capable of operating in the Industry 4.0 environment. However, it is observed that there is no effective method of assessing whether these devices effectively integrate such technologies and at what level this integration occurs. This manuscript adopted the design science research methodology to propose a method for assessing the adherence of internal logistics equipment to the CPS concept for Industry 4.0. The method is based on a guide for collecting data with questions that identify information about the CPS technologies embedded in the internal logistics equipment, associated with a tool for processing this information. The tool is supported by a properly trained artificial neural network that measures the equipment's adherence to the CPS concept. The method has proved to be adequate because in its application it assessed fifteen equipment, from worldwide-renowned manufacturers, with an error of less than 2%. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Assessment method; Cyber-physical systems; Industry 4.0; Internal logistics","Embedded systems; Internet of things; Neural networks; Service industry; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Design-science researches; Internal Logistics; Internet of Services; Internet of Things (IOT); ITS applications; Key technologies; Production cycle; Industry 4.0",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087492951

As an extension of that, this study aims to examine the relationship between Muslim populations and the prevalence of entrepreneurial activity across nations. Integrated with institutional theory, the authors also consider formal and informal institutional variables as contingency factors in this milieu. So, it further investigates if the strategic intervention of formal and informal institutions moderates the relationship between religion and entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses multi-source data sets from the association of religious data archive, global entrepreneurship monitor and the World Bank. The sample includes 88 countries for analysis, aggregated from 2012 to 2014. The ordinary least squares regression using statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) Statistics Version 26 is used for the analysis. Findings: The findings show that Muslim populations are negatively associated with the rate of new business activities in a country, including the formal type of entrepreneurship. However, further analysis reveals that Muslims entrepreneurship is actually driven by necessity and not by opportunity. Practical implications: The regulatory environment and entrepreneurial culture are not enough to overcome resistance toward entrepreneurship among Muslims. One possible practical recommendation is to empower religious institutions to preach a clear message supporting participation in economic activities. Social implications: This research sheds light on the discrepancy between Islamic religious teaching and eventual behavior of the followers. Originality/value: This research contributes to both academics and practitioners in several ways. First, it responds to the recent call for more studies on the effect of religious beliefs toward secular organizations by providing empirical evidence on how the prevalence of Muslims in a particular country is associated with levels of entrepreneurship. Second, it adds to the theoretical understanding of the mechanism that explains the relationship between the two. As institutional theory has not been applied extensively in the study of religion and entrepreneurship, it proposes that dynamic institutions play major roles to accelerate or attenuate the effect of Islam on entrepreneurship. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurship; Institutional theory; Islam; Muslim; Muslims; Religion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087629604

The main challenge in linking data and decision making is the extant inconsistencies and lack of compatibility between information architectures and the decision making mechanisms in many corporate. Our proposed holistic approach aims to gap the bridge between data science and proactive decision making. Based on the proposed architecture and model, we propose a practical roadmap for manufacturers to become more proactive in their business development and capacity planning. We specifically focus on the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) systems, and demonstrate and validate our approach with a real life application via our ongoing collaboration with a major aviation MRO company. Maintenance-repair-overhaul (MRO) service providers are constantly subject to internal and external challenges due to unsteady workload, congestion, stringent customer requirements, etc. As workload fluctuates over time, work teams can speed up or speed down to cope with fulfilling deadlines and other customer requirements. As we illustrate using a case study from the aviation MRO industry, the relationship between workload and the service rates is typically nonlinear. Although data analytics can be employed to capture this relationship, incorporating it into decision making on planning and cost management is a nontrivial task. Collecting such data in right format and transforming them into useful input for predictive models require a multi-faceted information architecture. Subsequently, the output of the predictive models must be fed into decision making models. In this case study, we demonstrate how such a mapping from data to decision making can be designed and implemented effectively. The proposed holistic methodology assigns service orders to time slots based on the workload-throughput mapping. Depending on the current and future scheduled workload, the decision module aims to minimize the total cost of delaying orders and proposes optimal release (start) times for arriving service requests. The solution algorithm proposed for the decision making module first identifies an initial feasible solution by formulating all turnaround times for upcoming orders based on their original request dates. Then, it makes gradual improvements based on a survival analysis. We demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide useful valuation of service time slots for revenue management. © 2020 Towards the Digital World and Industry X.0 - Proceedings of the 29th International Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2020.

Accordingly, this study aims to propose a multi-tier architecture to support the collection, processing, analytics and usage of mobility data in providing eMaaS within smart cities. The architecture uses application programming interfaces to enable interoperability between different infrastructures required for eMaaS and allow multiple partners to exchange and share data for making decision regarding electric mobility services. Design/methodology/approach: Design science methodology based on a case study by interview was used to collect data from an infrastructure company in Norway to verify the applicability of the proposed multi-tier architecture. Findings: Findings suggest that the architecture offers an approach for collecting, aggregating, processing and provisioning of data originating from sources to improve electric mobility in smart cities. More importantly, findings from this study provide guidance for municipalities and policymakers in improving electric mobility services. Moreover, the author’s findings provide a practical data-driven mobility use case that can be used by transport companies in deploying eMaaS in smart cities. Research limitations/implications: Data was collected from a single company in Norway, hence, it is required to further verify the architecture with data collected from other companies. Practical implications: eMaaS operates on heterogeneous data, which are generated from EVs and used by citizens and stakeholders such as city administration, municipality transport providers, charging station providers and so on. Therefore, the proposed architecture enables the sharing and usage of generated data as openly available data to be used in creating value-added services to improve citizen’s quality of life and viability of businesses. Social implications: This study proposes the deployment of electric mobility to address increased usage of vehicles, which contributes to pollution of the environment that has a serious effect on citizen’s quality of life.

From multidisciplinary angles, areas of tension and related research questions are explored from advertising, business, computer science, and legal perspectives. The proposed research agendas include exploring transparency of computational advertising practice and consumer education; understanding the trade-off between explainability and performance of algorithms; exploring the issue of new consumers as free data laborers, data as commodity, and related consumer agency challenges; understanding the relationship between algorithmic transparency and consumers’ literacy; evaluating the trade-off between algorithmic fairness and privacy protection; examining legal and regulatory issues regarding power imbalance between actors in the computational advertising ecosystem; and studying the trade-off between technological innovation and consumer protection and empowerment. © 2020 The Author(s).

However, do their front-line employees follow this trend? To achieve an effective and efficient CSR, the front-line employees have to share the CSR perception advanced by their businesses. The main objective of the study is to discover, critically assess and compare the CSR perception of the front-line employees of the top luxury fashion industry businesses located in Prague, Czech Republic. Design/Methodology/Approach: An investigative case study of the CSR approach of such employees of all ten top luxury fashion businesses in Prague is performed while using a holistic Meta-Analysis, a manual Delphi method and three rounds of interviews, along with mystery shopping techniques. Results: The heterogenous conglomerate of data reveals: (i) problematic awareness of these employees, (ii) their ignorance of the legal setting, (iii) an imbalance and preferential focus, along with ignorance of certain CSR categories, (iv) direct and indirect contradictions and (v) a preoccupation with the fur issue. Conclusions: This alarming inconsistencies and ambiguity have strong implications for both science and practice, they call for more studies, a deeper understanding of causes and a prompt correction in order to make the CSR perception of these important inside stakeholders be in line with expectations. © 2020 Robert K.

Moreover, the study is based on analyzing the influence of SC integration on the interactive relation as a strategic lever. There is a need to consider potential implications of efficient relation between SC operational capability and corporate competitive capability to develop integrated and coherent strategies for the strategic role of SCM. The decisions linked with the sourcing of products, planning capacity, conversion into final products, distribution, communication, demand management, and delivery is regarded as SC operational capability. The study has opted the SEM-PLS for the analysis of the data, which is among the most recent and robust data analysis technique especially for the structural issues in social sciences. The data is collected with the aid of a questionnaire which was developed basing on the prior studies. It has been stressed by previous studies on manufacturing strategy and SCM that the decisions of SCM must be aligned and strategic with the business strategy of the firm. However, consistent results have not revealed by previous literature about the shape of the interactive association between SCM strategy and corporate strategy.

Our analysis shows that the emergence of entrepreneurial ideas in natural sciences is positively affected by proximity to business schools.

In an open market, the behaviours of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), private firms and multinational corporations (MNCs) pose an implicit greenwashing threat. Our focal point is to analyse corporate greenwashing in MNCs in host emerging markets, particularly in Asia, for two reasons. First, reports of greenwashing have increased around the world since Volkswagen was revealed to have falsified automobile emissions data. Second, MNCs play an important role in expanding market size and their behaviour is increasingly unpredictable. The analysis shows that MNCs tend to engage in greenwashing immediately after doing business in host emerging markets characterised by restricted regulations, clear market opportunities and low competitive pressure.

Throughout this paper frugal innovation is reported as a phenomenon, concept, research field and strategy, showing the different ways the literature refers to it and how scattered the concept is. However, based on the understanding, the authors decided to address frugal innovation as a kind of innovation strategy that helps companies to innovate in resource-constrained environments. Therefore, considering the increasing interest in the frugal innovation topic and adding the perspective of business strategy for resource-constrained conditions, the research question addressed in this paper is: what are the main features of the frugal innovation literature that unfold its current perspectives for business strategy? In this sense, the purpose of this study is to analyze the scientific production in frugal innovation through a literature mapping and review to better understand it, delimiting different perspectives and creating boundaries to other business strategies or approaches. Design/methodology/approach: The authors performed a co-citation analysis using the Vosviewer software to notice how authors are arranged in clusters based on their understanding of the topic. Furthermore, the authors also performed a systematic literature review (SLR) analyzing the extant literature on frugal innovation based on the clusters found through the co-citation method. The final sample used in the study included 42 papers published between 2011 and 2019, using the Web of Science platform as a data source. Findings: By means of SLR, the findings of this study provided a more organized view of frugal innovation through the co-citation analysis and the qualitative analysis of the clusters, which were the basis for the parameters established. After the conceptualization of frugal innovation strategy (FIS) and the delimitation of boundaries of FIS, the authors bring the reflections about the contribution to the literature and the practice (managers and society) by showing three assumptions to be tested and confirmed in future studies and a framework to guide companies in search of a FIS. Originality/value: This study contributes to the discussion on frugal innovation moving a step forward to clarify the research field on this subject providing the main characteristics for researchers and practitioners. The paper has delimited the boundaries of FIS. The assumptions established in the discussion can become hypotheses for empirical studies. In addition, the authors explain why, what is, where and to whom the FIS can be developed and applied. Furthermore, the authors contribute by developing the FIS framework, with four strategic positions based on the boundaries of FIS organized by the complexity technological level. The strategic positions are frugal innovation orientation (FIO), FIO to value shared, FIO to market and FIS. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bibliometric mapping; Co-citation analysis; Frugal innovation; Strategy; Systematic literature review",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081735770

It aims to update the current knowledge on SIDM practices in large manufacturing companies. The research question underlying this study: Are recently developed analysis techniques (i.e. those that aim to integrate strategic and financial analyses) being used to evaluate strategic investment projects? Design/methodology/approach: The research evidence underpinning this study was made up of primary and secondary data, quantitative and qualitative. Firstly, a survey consisting of a mailed formal standard questionnaire was conducted where each respondent is required to answer the same questions based on the same system of coded responses. Secondly, qualitative data was collected using the annual reports of selected companies. Disclosures were used as supplementary source of information using the explanatory notes and parenthetical disclosures accompanying companies’ financial reporting. Sources for these disclosures included management discussions, analyses of company strategy and risk and forward-looking reports regarding future performance and growth opportunities (such as mergers and acquisitions activities). Accordingly, companies’ disclosures were used in this study as an alternative method to semi-structured interviews to collect qualitative data. More recently, companies such as Rio Tinto have prepared strategic annual reports for 2017 against the UK Corporate Governance Code (version 2016). Findings: The choice and use of financial analysis techniques and risk analysis techniques depend on the type of project being evaluated. Decision makers in large UK companies do not appear to use emergent analysis techniques widely. Pre-decision control mechanisms have significant influence on SIDM practices. This includes the changes of internal and external contextual factors, including organisational culture, organisational strategies, financial consideration, comprising formal approval governance mechanisms, regulatory and other compliance policies interact with companies’ internal control systems. Companies incorporate non-financial factors alongside quantitative analysis of strategic investments opportunities. Energy efficiency and carbon reduction are key imperatives of companies’ environmental management. These factors viewed by decision makers as significant factors relevant for compliance with legislation as well as maintaining companies’ legitimacy issues, sustainable business, experience with new technology and improved company image. Research limitations/implications: High risk, ambiguity and complexity are key characteristics embedded in SIDM processes. Macroeconomic issues remain crucial factors in scanning and screening investment opportunities, as reported by this study. The early stage of SIDM processes requires modelling under macroeconomic scenarios and assumptions of both internal and external parameters. Key assumptions include: projections of economic growth; commodity prices and exchange rates, introduction of technological and productivity advancements; cost and supply parameters for major inputs. SIDM practices rooted on comprehensive knowledge and experience of the industry and markets to draw subjective judgements about the riskiness of prospective projects, but these are rarely formalized into their SIDM processes. Findings of this study, however, remain within the context of UK companies. This study has its own limitations due to its time, location, respondents and sample selection, the size and the sector of the selected companies and questions addressed. Findings of this study raise a call for future research to examine SIDM processes in different settings to explore the relative impact of various organisational control mechanisms on SIDM practices. Also, to examine the influence of contextual factors (such as national culture, political, legal and social factors) on organisational control mechanisms. SIDM practices and processes have received significant attention from researchers, yet there is a lack of evidence in the literature about how companies approach strategic decision-making regarding divestments of some of their strategic investments. This type of strategic decision-making is not less important than other types of SIDM practices. Practical implications: SIDM practices reflect the art and science of steering and controlling organisational resources to achieve a desired strategy. To understand the factors that shape SIDM practices and align them to organisational strategy, more attention is required to the choice and design of pre-decision controls and to the important role of strategic management accounting tools over the more traditional financial analysis techniques that have formed the focus of much prior empirical research. Social implications: Key environmental issues viewed by decision makers as significant factors relevant for compliance with legislation as well as maintaining companies’ legitimacy issues and company image. Originality/value: Despite their perceived importance in this study, quantitative accounting controls may fail to connect with the kind of investment decision-making required to bring strategic success. Indeed, it has been widely noted that financial evaluation techniques are inadequate for assessing strategic investment proposals; they can only function as a guideline, as SIDM practices involve so many uncertainties, risks and judgements. A key insight from this study is that the achievement of integration between the firm’s strategic investment projects and the overall organizational strategy forms a critical pre-decision control on managerial behaviour at an early stage in SIDM practices. As many strategic investment decisions are one-off, non-repeatable decisions, the information needed to support their evaluation is likely to be similarly unique. Sound SIDM practices require the support of a large amount of varied information, a significant proportion of which is collected and analysed prior to potential capital investment projects being considered, such as information related to strategic goal setting, risk-adjusted hurdle rates and the design of appropriate organisational decision hierarchies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Financial and risk analysis techniques; Investment appraisal techniques; Large UK Manufacturing Companies; Pre-decision control mechanisms; Strategic control mechanisms; Strategic Investment Decision-Making",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082198319

As a result, many industries have been deprived of efficient risk reducing strategy and solutions. This paper argues that risk reduction is underlined by domain-independent methods and principles which, combined with knowledge from the specific domain, help to generate effective risk reduction solutions. In this respect, the paper introduces a powerful method for reducing the likelihood of computational errors based on combining the domain-independent method of segmentation and local knowledge of the chain rule for differentiation. The paper also demonstrates that lack of knowledge of domain-independent principles for risk reduction misses opportunities to reduce the risk of failure even in a mature field like stress analysis. The domain-independent methods for risk reduction do not rely on reliability data or knowledge of physical mechanisms underlying possible failure modes and are particularly well suited for developing new designs, with unknown failure mechanisms and failure history. In many cases, the reliability improvement and risk reduction by using the domain-independent methods reduces risk at no extra cost or at a relatively small cost. The presented domain-independent methods work across unrelated domains and this is demonstrated by the supplied examples which range from various areas of engineering and technology, computer science, project management, health risk management, business and mathematics. The domain-independent risk reduction methods presented in this paper promote building products and systems characterised by high-reliability and resilience. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","domain-independent methods; domain-specific methods; reliability improvement; Risk reduction; TRIZ","Failure (mechanical); Health risks; Project management; Reliability; Risk management; Stress analysis; Domain independents; Domain specific; Reliability improvement; Risk reductions; TRIZ; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067872542

Design/methodology/approach: Using two rounds of the Ecuadorian National Science, Technology and Innovation Activities Survey (ACTI 2012 and 2015) and a data set on gross value added (GVA) by industry, we run a sample correction model applied to a panel data of 1,023 firms from 2009 to 2014. Findings: In deciding whether to invest in R&D, the higher an industry’s GVA, the lower the predicted probability that firms in that industry would invest. Additionally, R&D investments are not procyclical, and there is marginal evidence that they might actually be countercyclical. These findings are consistent with Schumpeter (1939) and Ouyang (2011) and are likely due to an increased opportunity cost of R&D investment during the oil boom. Originality/value: In this study, we examine a boom period and not a full business cycle. This boom is driven by an exogenous shock, deviating from much of the current literature, which focuses on endogenously driven business cycles.

Prior studies have mainly focused on the direct effect of IT use on innovation performance, while little is known about how IT use for different purposes in the innovation processes leads to innovation performance at the organizational level. Drawing on the routine-based absorptive capacity (AC) framework, we conceptualize IT use for knowledge search and relational search as IT-enabled internal and external AC routines and unveil the hierarchical benefits resulting from IT use for innovation. We propose a model in which firms need to purposefully use IT to search for knowledge in the new product development process or search for relationships in the collaborative innovation process, leading to first-order benefits (i.e., internal innovation benefits and open innovation benefits) and, in turn, second-order benefits (i.e., innovation performance). By using a unique data set from 1028 German firms between 2003 and 2007, we find that IT use for knowledge search enhances internal innovation benefits, whereas IT use for relational search increases open innovation benefits. More importantly, internal and open innovation benefits mediate the relationships between IT use for knowledge and relational search and various innovation performance measures. Taken together, our findings shed light on a deeper understanding of the digital innovation value chain. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Digital innovation; Hierarchical business value; Information technology use; Knowledge search; Relational search","Information science; Information systems; Business value; Digital innovations; Information technology use; Knowledge search; Relational search; Product development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073823939

Data from the Central Bureau of Statistics Indonesia shows that 87.18 per cent of the total population of Indonesia are Muslims. In addition to running the ruling of Islam and the pillars of Faith, Muslims also maintain the religious tourism. The form of religious tourism which is widely followed by the Muslims of Indonesia is to follow a pilgrimage to the tomb of the wali (Guardian), both wali limo and wali songo. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a qualitative approach. Data collection was done using in-depth interviews of Muslims in Indonesia who had already attended pilgrimages to wali limo and/or wali songo. Findings: The tourists are satisfied and have an intention to revisit the destination, and the interest of the community to follow religious tours is very large, as well as the opportunities to do business in this sector are still wide open. Various motives and benefits of following religious tours, as well as suggestions for improvements for religious tourism destination managers, as well as advice for the government were uncovered. Thus, the results of this study are expected to provide a theoretical contribution related to marketing management in religious tourism and a practical contribution for the managers of religious tourism. Research limitations/implications: Further research can be done with a quantitative approach, as well as comparative studies between pilgrimages in Indonesia (developing countries) and pilgrimages in other developing countries or in developed countries can also be conducted. Practical implications: For marketing practitioners, the results of this study can be used as a consideration to continue to improve services in the field of religious tourism in the country, given the potential for development is very large. Social implications: There is a contribution from this study to the development of marketing science, particularly related to marketing management on religious tourism services.

We compare findings with recent studies of retracted papers in economics, and business and management, to profile practices that are likely to be problematic in cognate social science disciplines. In psychology, the principal reason for retraction was data fabrication. Retractions took longer to make, and generally were from higher ranked and more prestigious journals, than in the two cognate disciplines. We recommend that journal editors should be more forthcoming in the reasons they provide for article retractions. We also recommend that the discipline of psychology gives a greater priority to the publication of replication studies; initiates a debate about how to respond to failed replications; adopts a more critical attitude to the importance of attaining statistical significance; discourages p-hacking and Hypothesizing After Results are Known (HARKing); assesses the long-term effects of pre-registering research; and supports stronger procedures to attest to the authenticity of data in research papers. Our contribution locates these issues in the context of a growing crisis of confidence in the value of social science research.

As a part of the modern service industry, finance has developed rapidly in the Internet world, provoking researchers to study the effects of finance and investor on various dimensions of the societal life. Although many studies have analyzed the impact of the Internet on finance, few of them have mentioned the investors, such as their attention, sentiment and attitudes. Based on the 481 articles retrieved by Web of Science, this paper makes a systematic review, which can provide a direction for future research and make up the research gap. Research papers published between 1989 and 2020 were selected and grouped according to publication year, institutions and publication sources. The results showed that in recent years, the publishing industry in various countries developed rapidly, and the research fields involved finance, management, economics, organizational law, business, and other disciplines.

The purpose of this paper is to highlight the exacerbating pressure on Indian academics to deliver incessantly in terms of research output and identify an agreeable way to increase research output. The metric explores trends in management publications by Indian academics and presents an overview of collaborative practices by Indian management researchers that could shine a light on the trends of collaborative publishing future. Design/methodology/approach: The study focuses on publications in the area of Business and Management. Scopus was used with advanced filters to draw relevant research papers. Data were then sorted and filtered on the basis of quality determined through Australian Business Deans Council rankings and diverse bibliometric information to understand the pattern of research output of Indian academics. Findings: The research found that the rate of collaboration with researchers from the home country is low for top rated publications. Majority of publications were listed in Scopus indexed journals, whereas a handful featured in A and A* journals. A and A* journals were predominantly co-authored with academics from universities outside the country. Tradeoff was achieved by majority of authors by getting published in B, followed by C category journals to achieve research outputs. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited to publications in the area of Business and Management and may be extended to other disciplines such as economics, engineering, law, medical sciences, etc., to understand publishing trends at universities in the country. The study can also be conducted in understanding a similar dilemma with academics at other countries that are evolving in research culture. Practical implications: The study would help management researchers to dig deep into the root cause and understand why and how collaborations within and outside the country impact the quality of publications. The results would further encourage ranking agencies to award suitable grades to colleges that promote collaboration within the country as well as international collaboration. The study also conducts a benchmarking exercise of the institutions in the country that would be useful for researchers, journals and colleges. Originality/value: While earlier studies have highlighted the importance of foreign collaborations in academic publishing, there are a handful of studies that have focused on the role of collaboration within the home country. The practice of Indian authors collaborating with Indian counterparts at other universities would help understand the expertise of researchers at different universities and encourage the collaboration process and quality of publications in the country. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Benchmarking; Management education",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074432811

The research focuses on HBS signature pedagogy, the case method and its role in the institutionalization of managerial knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on a qualitative content analysis of HBS Annals published between 1908 and 1930. Through a manual coding of the Annals, the paper traces the diffusion of the case method in the curriculum and connects it with the institutional transformations that took place between 1908 and 1930. Findings: The data show how HBS curriculum transitioned from lectures to case teaching in the aftermath of First World War. This pedagogy allowed HBS to demonstrate the possibility of systematically investigate management problems and to deliver business education at scale. The discussion argues that the case method, acting as a boundary object between business praxis and management theories, constituted management as a science-based profession. Originality/value: Recent debates have emerged about case method’s ability to critically question socio-economic structures within which business is conducted. This paper contributes to the debate arguing that the historical and institutional factors leading to the affirmation of this pedagogical approach had a substantive role in the type of knowledge produced through its application. The findings challenge the idea that the affirmation of the case method is attributable to its epistemological primacy in investigating business problems. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Boundary object; Case method; Harvard Business School; Ontological model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078220104

However, some critical steps, such as identifying processes suitable for RPA automation, can have a tremendous impact in organizations if a wrong process is selected. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide an approach for analyzing RPA development in business organizations.

A model connecting the main elicited RPA concepts is presented as well as its evaluation and applicability grounded of past RPA case study (CS) analysis, using design science research. Findings: The results from this research show that most of the RPA main concepts gathered in the literature review are not reported in the selected RPA CSs. Originality/value: As RPA is a recent topic, literature lacks a synthetization of RPA main topics. This research aims to fill the gap on that, by identifying and synthesize the main topics related to RPA and proposing a model that connects the main RPA concepts, which can be used by researchers as a schema for conducting and writing RPA case studies. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business process management; Data science; Process automation; Robotic process automation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074021891

The preferred significant procedures for retention strategy among the IT industry is required to be made for the sustenance of competition amongst the giant IT companies. Many organizations have faced an increasingly competitive global business climate over the past decade. Therefore, various organizations are preparing different strategies to raise employees ' training and retention strategies to improve their performance. As a result, existing HR expertise has become imperative due to the rapidly changing technologies and competitive climate in the Information System (IT), as a result of which the dedication and role of top HRD management is quite a challenge. The study was conducted to determine the importance of the IT sector's staff training and retention approaches across Odisha. Results indicate that staff training has several issues, such as industry impediments; cost issues, employee disposition, and manager's myopia.

We propose a novel two-sided recommender system framework, which considers emergence on both sides of the platform and adapts to the changing environment to influence agents.

This study adopts a user-centred approach to systematically explore the process of developing a serious game as an interpretive tool for the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The study uses a gaming conceptual framework, the Design-Play-Experience (DPE) model and data were collected in situ, on reef tours, by observing respondents’ interactions with the game, video recording and reviewing their gameplay and through pre and post interviews with respondents until data saturation was reached (n = 34). The findings illustrate how games can be designed to represent a complex and threatened ecosystem and elicit positive emotions among tourists, particularly curiosity and delight. The study illustrates the usefulness of the DPE framework to move beyond a simple description of games to a systematic, user-centred analysis of the process of creating a serious game to solve a particular interpretive problem. The study also confirms that designing a bespoke game for a tourist attraction is a costly and difficult process, requiring iterations of the game design, that is arguably outside the scope of many nature-based/heritage tourism businesses. © 2020 CAUTHE - COUNCIL FOR AUSTRALASIAN TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY EDUCATION","Design science; Interpretation; Reef tourism; Serious games; Virtual reality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078999079

We contribute to this debate by reviewing a sample of articles dealing with the short-term directional forecasting of the prices of stocks, commodities, and currencies. Screening all relevant articles published in 2016 by one of the 96 journals covered by the Social Sciences Citation Index in the category “Business, Finance,” we select only those studies that use easily accessible data of daily or higher frequency. We examine each study in detail, from the selection of the dataset to the interpretation of the results. We also include empirical analyses to illustrate the shortcomings of certain approaches. There are three main findings from our review. First, the number of selected papers is very low, which is surprising even when the strict selection criteria are taken into account. Second, there are hardly any relevant studies that use high-frequency data—despite the hype about financial big data and machine learning. Third, the economic significance of the findings—for example, their usefulness for trading purposes—is questionable. In general, apparently good forecasting performance does not translate into profitability once realistic transaction costs and the effect of data snooping are taken into account.

The fourth industrial revolution, with convergent disruptions in biology, business models, computer science, and culture, has the potential to transform the healthcare system like never before. Digital health startups, Big Tech and progressive health systems will change the way health and healthcare are delivered to increasingly digitally savvy consumers. This book challenges readers to rethink the role of data and technology in creating and designing the future. Rather than hooking value-based care and population health management onto traditional healthcare business models, it focuses on the emergence of digital ecosystems. Using the analogy of an orchestra, the book introduces the importance of platforms in the formation of communities and markets with network effects to allow participants to collaborate, create, and innovate. With quotes from healthcare industry leaders and change agents, it helps the strategist understand the three stages of the transition from volume to value. As conductor of the orchestra, the CEO must navigate important leadership pivots to move beyond silo-based thinking. Finally, the Care Management Platform is described as a new operating model for population health in the digital age. As the next generation beyond foundational EHRs, capabilities such as interoperability, analytics, care management and patient/consumer engagement will fundamentally change the way healthcare enterprises operate and deliver value to customers. 2020 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. © All rights reserved.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108262661

This study aims to present a prospective answer to this question by empirically examining the relationships among human capital outcomes (entrepreneurial knowledge and skills) and the number of business ideas generated and implemented. Additionally, the authors examined the moderating effect of the entrepreneurial self-efficacy on the proposed relationships.

Findings: The results from the analysis indicated that human capital outcomes (entrepreneurial knowledge and skills) are positively related to the number of generated and implemented ideas. Furthermore, it was seen that entrepreneurial self-efficacy significantly moderates the relationship between human capital outcomes and the number of implemented ideas. However, self-efficacy has no significant moderating effect on the relationships among human capital outcomes and the number of generated ideas. Finally, the results showed that the number of ideas generated mediates the relationships among human capital outcomes and the number of ideas implemented.

Design/methodology/approach: The FNN has gained much attention from researchers to make a more informed decision in the last few decades. The literature survey is focused on the learning algorithms and the optimization techniques proposed in the last three decades. This paper (Part II) is an extension of Part I. For the sake of simplicity, the paper entitled “Machine learning facilitated business intelligence (Part I): Neural networks learning algorithms and applications” is referred to as Part I. To make the study consistent with Part I, the approach and survey methodology in this paper are kept similar to those in Part I. Findings: Combining the work performed in Part I, the authors studied a total of 80 articles through popular keywords searching. The FNN learning algorithms and optimization techniques identified in the selected literature are classified into six categories based on their problem identification, mathematical model, technical reasoning and proposed solution. Previously, in Part I, the two categories focusing on the learning algorithms (i.e. gradient learning algorithms for network training, gradient free learning algorithms) are reviewed with their real-world applications in management, engineering, and health sciences. Therefore, in the current paper, Part II, the remaining four categories, exploring optimization techniques (i.e. optimization algorithms for learning rate, bias and variance (underfitting and overfitting) minimization algorithms, constructive topology neural networks, metaheuristic search algorithms) are studied in detail. The algorithm explanation is made enriched by discussing their technical merits, limitations, and applications in their respective categories. Finally, the authors recommend future new research directions which can contribute to strengthening the literature. Research limitations/implications: The FNN contributions are rapidly increasing because of its ability to make reliably informed decisions. Like learning algorithms, reviewed in Part I, the focus is to enrich the comprehensive study by reviewing remaining categories focusing on the optimization techniques. However, future efforts may be needed to incorporate other algorithms into identified six categories or suggest new category to continuously monitor the shift in the research trends. Practical implications: The authors studied the shift in research trend for three decades by collectively analyzing the learning algorithms and optimization techniques with their applications. This may help researchers to identify future research gaps to improve the generalization performance and learning speed, and user to understand the applications areas of the FNN. For instance, research contribution in FNN in the last three decades has changed from complex gradient-based algorithms to gradient free algorithms, trial and error hidden units fixed topology approach to cascade topology, hyperparameters initial guess to analytically calculation and converging algorithms at a global minimum rather than the local minimum. Originality/value: The existing literature surveys include comparative study of the algorithms, identifying algorithms application areas and focusing on specific techniques in that it may not be able to identify algorithms categories, a shift in research trends over time, application area frequently analyzed, common research gaps and collective future directions. Part I and II attempts to overcome the existing literature surveys limitations by classifying articles into six categories covering a wide range of algorithm proposed to improve the FNN generalization performance and convergence rate. The classification of algorithms into six categories helps to analyze the shift in research trend which makes the classification scheme significant and innovative. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Data analytics; Feedforward neural network; Industrial management; Machine learning; Optimization techniques","Complex networks; Data Analytics; Feedforward neural networks; Focusing; Global optimization; Industrial management; Information analysis; Information management; Learning systems; Machine learning; Surveys; Topology; Design/methodology/approach; Generalization performance; Gradient learning algorithm; Meta-heuristic search algorithms; Minimization algorithms; Optimization algorithms; Optimization techniques; Problem identification; Learning algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077615166

Design/methodology/approach: The FNN has gained much popularity during the last three decades. Therefore, the authors have focused on algorithms proposed during the last three decades. The selected databases were searched with popular keywords: “generalization performance,” “learning rate,” “overfitting” and “fixed and cascade architecture.” Combinations of the keywords were also used to get more relevant results. Duplicated articles in the databases, non-English language, and matched keywords but out of scope, were discarded. Findings: The authors studied a total of 80 articles and classified them into six categories according to the nature of the algorithms proposed in these articles which aimed at improving the generalization performance and convergence rate of FNNs. To review and discuss all the six categories would result in the paper being too long. Therefore, the authors further divided the six categories into two parts (i.e. Part I and Part II). The current paper, Part I, investigates two categories that focus on learning algorithms (i.e. gradient learning algorithms for network training and gradient-free learning algorithms). Furthermore, the remaining four categories which mainly explore optimization techniques are reviewed in Part II (i.e. optimization algorithms for learning rate, bias and variance (underfitting and overfitting) minimization algorithms, constructive topology neural networks and metaheuristic search algorithms). For the sake of simplicity, the paper entitled “Machine learning facilitated business intelligence (Part II): Neural networks optimization techniques and applications” is referred to as Part II. This results in a division of 80 articles into 38 and 42 for Part I and Part II, respectively. After discussing the FNN algorithms with their technical merits and limitations, along with real-world management, engineering and health sciences applications for each individual category, the authors suggest seven (three in Part I and other four in Part II) new future directions which can contribute to strengthening the literature. Research limitations/implications: The FNN contributions are numerous and cannot be covered in a single study. The authors remain focused on learning algorithms and optimization techniques, along with their application to real-world problems, proposing to improve the generalization performance and convergence rate of FNNs with the characteristics of computing optimal hyperparameters, connection weights, hidden units, selecting an appropriate network architecture rather than trial and error approaches and avoiding overfitting. Practical implications: This study will help researchers and practitioners to deeply understand the existing algorithms merits of FNNs with limitations, research gaps, application areas and changes in research studies in the last three decades. Moreover, the user, after having in-depth knowledge by understanding the applications of algorithms in the real world, may apply appropriate FNN algorithms to get optimal results in the shortest possible time, with less effort, for their specific application area problems. Originality/value: The existing literature surveys are limited in scope due to comparative study of the algorithms, studying algorithms application areas and focusing on specific techniques. This implies that the existing surveys are focused on studying some specific algorithms or their applications (e.g. pruning algorithms, constructive algorithms, etc.). In this work, the authors propose a comprehensive review of different categories, along with their real-world applications, that may affect FNN generalization performance and convergence rate. This makes the classification scheme novel and significant. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Data analytics; Feedforward neural network; Industrial management; Learning algorithm; Machine learning","Data Analytics; Decision making; Feedforward neural networks; Industrial management; Information analysis; Information management; Learning systems; Machine learning; Network architecture; Optimization; Surveys; Design/methodology/approach; Generalization performance; Gradient learning algorithm; Meta-heuristic search algorithms; Minimization algorithms; Optimization algorithms; Simple and efficient algorithms; Trial-and-error approach; Learning algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077562968

The main data source for the analysis is the NIFU Graduate Survey for the period 1995–2015, where data on graduate numbers as well as detailed information about graduate employment are collected. According to a narrow definition, business administration, information and computer technology, electronic, mechanical and machine subjects and teacher training and pedagogy were specialized education. Using a broad definition, this also includied languages, humanities and arts other, psychology, health, welfare and sport, law and political science.

This method unlocks the full potential of a well using completion design parameters optimization that considers all the factors that impact well performance, geological characteristics, well trajectory, spacing, etc. By leveraging basin-level knowledge captured by big data sculpting with the use of uncertainty quantification, Augmented AI can provide quick and science-based answers for completion optimization, and also assess the full potential of an asset in unconventional reservoirs. By leveraging computer vision and natural language processing techniques, unstructured data from various sources were deciphered, combined and organized into a structured database. Imputation techniques were used to fill the gaps of missing data. With the Augmented AI approach, the median accuracies of IP and EUR predictions for new drills is around 90%, which often outperforms industry-standard type curving methods. With the explainable machine learning (ML) model, the direct impact of completion design parameters on well performance is deconvoluted among other parameters, such as engineering and geological attributes. The prediction also comes with an 80% confidence interval to quantify the prediction uncertainties, which allows for better risk management and confident business decision making. With the ML model and given economic inputs and metrics, many sensitivity analyses are performed to evaluate optimized completion design parameters.

He finds that in comparison with other countries, Austrians have a thoroughly underdeveloped European consciousness.

The opposition to integration in Europe also appears to him to be emotionally based rather than grounded in reasoned opinions.

In today’s digital business environment, it has become difficult to identify fraudulent transactions with traditional methods. Developments in information (data) and information technology have helped increase anti-fraud control programs and fraud research opportunities. In particular, fraudulent financial reporting disrupts the reliability, accuracy, and efficiency of financial markets in terms of existence and continuity. The forensic accounting profession has been able to improve the effectiveness of inspections by using big data techniques, data analytics, and algorithms (Rezaee, Lo, Ha, & Suen, 2016; Seda & Kramer, 2014; Singleton & Singleton, 2010). The aim of the author, in this chapter, is to evaluate the contribution of using big data techniques in forensic accounting applications and the skills that will be provided to students while integrating these techniques in forensic accounting trainings. For this purpose, studies on forensic accounting education and their applications were reviewed.

CubeSat usually forms a formation/constellation, which boosts the capability of implementing complex space missions. However, the distributed CubeSat network is prone to malfunction. This paper envisions a maintenance architecture that includes launching and replenishing spare CubeSats to replace the faulty one on a regular basis. The major effort is to optimize this architecture in terms of total cost by taking the stochastic failures into consideration. In particular, a parametric model fitted from practical data is used to represent the realistic CubeSat lifetime distribution. A CubeSat lifetime database of 111 CubeSats has been built. The parametric model is obtained via a Bayesian estimation scheme. A cost model that is composed of fixed cost, holding cost, and shortage cost have been proposed. Then, A Monte Carlo simulation-based approach has been adopted to evaluate the cost. Finally, the optimal arrival time and quantity of backup CubeSats corresponding to minimal cost have been obtained by examining all the feasible combinations of arrival time and quantity of backup CubeSats. Results show that the CubeSat network should be replenished in the early stage which agrees with the high infant mortality trend of CubeSats. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CubeSat failure database; distributed CubeSat network; On-orbit service; Weibull distribution",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126106147

By using both cross-sectional and longitudinal panel studies, a positive relationship between online search interest related to an MNE’s product and corporation names and its financial performance is hypothesized and tested, and its managerial and theoretical implication is discussed. As a result of the extensive use of search engines, consumers and managers increasingly rely on online information in decision making. Information about search frequency reveals consumer interest and intention to make a transaction. Search data serve as a predictor for future demand, which means data from search engines not only reflect a different degree of interest of a product or corporation but also indicate a fundamental change in how to explain the present and predict future business (Wu and Brynjolfsson 2015). This study attempts to reveal the relationship between Google Trends data and MNEs financial performance, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. These findings have theoretical contributions and invaluable managerial implications as well. The established correlation between Google Trends data and business performance reassures managers of the importance of aggregate consumer interest. The present study extends findings by Du et al. (2015) who highlight the importance of feature keyword search in the automobile industry in the United States. This study adds a new perspective on existing MNE performance predictive model. Online search data represented by Google Trends provide a promising research avenue for International business. Krugman (2009) argues that social science has focused on developing complex statistic models to make business predictions. Even so, all the models have shown limited predictability of disruptive economic fluctuations. Simon (1984) advises that developing tools to explain and observe economic phenomena is better than focusing on models and noisy data in social science research. Search engine technology represented by Google Trends answers this call and provides useful aggregate data reflecting invaluable information such as consumers’ interest in a product feature and that feature’s importance as well as their buying intentions (Du et al. 2015). Analyzing search data helps researchers explain consumers’ intentions and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of predicting future economic activities (Wu and Brynjolfsson 2015). © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.","EWOM; Google trend; Performance; Search engine",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125225003

As such, it merits serious research attention from both a macro perspective (for example, a channel of distribution) and a micro perspective (for example, individual entrepreneurship). Moreover, the personal nature of direct selling, being based on a strong person-to-person interactive process, enables a variety of research endeavors that use direct selling to provide a vehicle or venue for data collection and testing hypotheses. Indeed, more than 150 peer-reviewed articles have been published on direct selling topics or have used direct selling data in research. The Academy of Marketing Science has a long history of interacting with direct selling companies. For example, direct selling companies CUTCO/Vector and Mary Kay have funded endowments used in AMS recognition activities and have “opened their doors” to marketing professors desiring research, databases, consulting, and internship opportunities. This history amplifies possibilities for pragmatic and theoretical research. This direct selling research special session features a panel of professors who are not only involved in direct selling research activities but also represent current and former leaders of AMS. Through this special session, conference participants are exposed to present, past, and potential research in the direct selling arena and to relevant topics across direct selling structures (Robert A.

By processing vast amounts of data and recognising patterns in the data, AI produces insights and analytics at or above human capability (IEEE 2017). It has been applied to fashion in trend forecasting, personalisation, customer interaction and the use of CGI models. For example, Amazon developed “Echo Look” which combines computer vision with predictive AI and human analysis to assess a consumer’s current wardrobe choices and provide recommendations of what to wear. Users can ask the machine to rate two different possible outfits in terms of current trends and actual appearance (Gibbs 2017). Online styling subscription Stitch Fix uses machine learning algorithms to determine its customers’ preferred styles and offer personalised recommendations. AI has also been developed to mimic the role of social media influencers and models. CGI character “Miquela” has 1.6 million Instagram followers, collaborates with luxury brands and launched her own clothing brand, but is not a real person. There is a dedicated digital modelling agency (Davis 2018). Such innovations are likely to further inflame the ongoing ethical debate about using digital technologies and virtual reality at the risk of opportunities for real people, for example diminishing already scarce opportunities for black models (Graham 2018), or introducing norms of artificial appearance and personal aesthetics impossible for ‘real’ people to achieve. AI has the potential to revolutionise fashion through greater precision, accuracy and effectiveness in decision-making, but at what cost? To what extent can and should AI replicate and replace human creativity and presence in an industry sector founded on human input in creating new trends? Yet, AI that predicts garment suitability and offers greater customisation for consumers may reduce waste and over-consumption (Snow 2017). Producing items which have greater relevance could reduce returns, markdowns and warehouse space, plus increase customer satisfaction and experience. Automating repetitive tasks could save money and time for greater value-added activities, for example through the use of chatbots for online customer service. This paper applies the lens of CSR to inform the debate on whether core fashion retailing functions can and should be replaced by AI. A CSR approach argues for businesses assuming social responsibilities beyond any economic, technical and legal obligations which constitute its existence, with the objective of reconciling economic, social and environmental objectives (Davis 1973). © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.","AI; CSR; Ethics; Fashion",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125202663

CRM practitioners face challenges such as efficient management of enormous amount of data generated by customer interactions plus extracting, analyzing and interpreting this data to give true value to the information received (Bradlow et al. 2017). A further challenge is the centralization of data from interactions on digital interfaces, social networks and Internet of Things (Culotta et al. 2015), in CRM to provide value for the business objectives. Whilst the application of artificial intelligence (AI) may seem like a radical innovation, most eminent predictive techniques- Neural networks (NN) and Classification and Regression trees (CART) have their roots in AI. Indeed, automated notifications and auto-responders are early examples of automation in customer relationship management. Of late, these automated forms of interactivity are becoming increasingly sophisticated with the rapid advancement in the AI technologies. Interestingly authors Kumar et al. (2016) point to an considerable increase of customer relationships and interactions with the businesses through automated means in near future, particularly as the main objective of AI as a science is to create intelligent machines to do things that otherwise would require intelligence if done by humans (Boden 1977). The quantity of academic works examining the impact of AI on CRM remains limited reflecting the nascence of the topic. However there remains a gap for work that examines the perceptions, understanding and attitudes of the business professionals who will be adopting and implementing AI in their business practices. In this paper we use Affordance Theory as a lens with which to identify the affordances and constraints that AI offers business practitioners. Drawing on the work of Nagy and Neff (2015) we utilize the concept of the “imagined affordance” to test a model of AI acceptance that draws user perception, attitudes and expectation. Our work develops the role of imagination and vision in technology acceptance research and provides an alternative approach to the dominant by rational, conscious and process-orientated perspectives (Nagy and Neff 2015). © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.","Affordance theory; AI; Artificial intelligence; CRM",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125181362

Over the past decade, advertising in games and persuasive advergames have been the two types of engaging technologies for promoting brands. However, it is becoming difficult for researchers in various disciplines to evaluate the impacts of gamification. Researchers and marketers have thus called for research that can provide well-thought-out gamification strategies as well as a thorough review of the state of the literature. The authors answer that call by proposing a bibliometric approach, which offers quantitative analytical tools to provide a more comprehensive overview of the literature. We particularly intend to go above and beyond a simple counting of publications or citations. The present study aims to map out the meaningful citation-based links between and among gamification research documents, and we hope to provide a visual representation of complex, networked, scholarly works. To clearly reveal the intellectual structure of gamification research, the authors compile bibliometric data using the ISI Web of Science, and identified 94 scholarly documents that were published in 32 different scholarly sources by 202 authors within the time period 1995–2018 (1697 citations and 3543 cited references), mostly from advertising and business fields. The authors first used a bibliographic coupling to measure a relationship between citing documents. The result shows the existence of five distinct clusters based on the coupling strength (e.g., research on gamification and cognitive reactions as marketing outcomes), which helps us detect different topical areas and identify new directions of research. The authors further map the intellectual tradition of gamification by assessing the relationship between cited documents. The co-citation analysis allows us to see the existence of six different thematic classifications and their theoretical foundations (e.g., research on gamification in the context of advertising literacy and consumers’ use of persuasion knowledge). The present research is among the first to apply both bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis in exploring the forefront of gamification research and its intellectual heritage. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.","Bibliographic coupling; Bibliometrics; Co-citation analysis; Gamification",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116736644

Modern asset management draws on a wide-range of fields beyond financial theory: economics, financial accounting, econometrics/statistics, management science, operations research (optimization and Monte Carlo simulation), and more recently, data science (Big Data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence). The challenge in writing an institutional asset management book is that when tools from these different fields are applied in an investment strategy or an analytical framework for valuing securities, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the fundamentals of these fields. Attempting to explain strategies and analytical concepts while also providing a primer on the tools from other fields is not the most effective way of describing the asset management process. Moreover, while an increasing number of investment models have been proposed in the asset management literature, there are challenges and issues in implementing these models. This book provides a description of the tools used in asset management as well as a more in-depth explanation of specialized topics and issues covered in the companion book, Fundamentals of Institutional Asset Management. The topics covered include the asset management business and its challenges, the basics of financial accounting, securitization technology, analytical tools (financial econometrics, Monte Carlo simulation, optimization models, and machine learning), alternative risk measures for asset allocation, securities finance, implementing quantitative research, quantitative equity strategies, transaction costs, multifactor models applied to equity and bond portfolio management, and backtesting methodologies.

This paper presents the findings of a pilot survey aimed at validating a questionnaire explicitly designed to gather data on the relationship between financial literacy and business performance among entrepreneurs. A total of 37 sampled respondents were used in the analysis using a stratified and clear random sampling technique. The data were analyzed with the assistance of the Statistical Kit for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23, of which the study of the variables and assessment of the reliability were carried out. As a result, only 44 of the 49 elements that initially formed the survey were retained. A total of 9 components emerged from the data that were named in accordance with their underlying constructs. The factor loadings reported met the appropriate threshold of .50. The reliability of the items and the respective scales was also within the acceptable range of .70. It was thus concluded that the questionnaire was reliable and could be used for the reason for which it was built. © IEOM Society International.","Factor analysis; pilot study; Principal component analysis; Reliability; Validity",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105582799

Employment of such graduates is fundamentally important for personal and economic development. There is a link between a bachelor’s and master's degree and how these qualifications are linked to the job market. Both horizontal and vertical mismatches are developed which is the central focus of this research. Design/methodology/approach: Given the differentiated nature of research questions, multiple techniques are used to collect the data. However, this research bears the norms of the qualitative method. Both secondary and primary data are used, and meanwhile secondary data are collected by the banks, Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics (BANBEIS), University Grants Commission (UGC) and by the institutions sampled. Primary data are gathered from interviews with key people. Data were collected from three institutions of higher education and from six commercial banks and from the Central Bank. The academic results of 21,325 MBA graduates and education backgrounds of 750 executives working in banks served as the basis for establishing our arguments. Findings: This study discovers that MBA graduates who have studied science subjects achieved much better grades in the MBA compared to their counterparts who studied business from secondary provision to first degree. The market-driven MBA programme has become a “business product”. The major revenue of higher education institutions comes from enrolment in MBA courses. For this reason, a science-friendly MBA program is developed to generate more business. If this continues, the philosophy of the master's program would either be lost or will have to be redefined in the 21st century. Originality/value: While a few studies have investigated the area of HE in Bangladesh, none covers the impact of MBA degrees on the job market and its contribution to enhancing job skills. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business development in the banking sector; Graduate skills and business development; Horizontal and vertical mismatches; Labour market; MBA",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104990937

From a demand side, the popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) is growing and particularly deep learning requires large amounts of data. From a supply side, new technology, such as Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and 5G mobile communications, will greatly expand data generation. However, data has remained a challenge. In data analytics companies are struggling with too much time spent on data preparation. As of today, data preparation for analytics has largely remained handmade and made-to-order like cars before Henry Ford industrialized the auto business through productization of cars and parts, and factory automation. Similarly, for data analytics to become a bigger business, data has to be productized. First “data factories” are emerging to create such data products economically. This article introduces a framework to guide construction of a data factory: What are the key modules, why are they important, how is best practice evolving? The article is building on (a) a foundation and in-depth case studies in the literature, (b) current meta research and systematic literature reviews (SLRs), and (c) our own observations building a data factory.

This paper aims to address the issue of supplier selection and purchasing planning considering the quality of data by benefiting from suppliers’ synergistic effects. Design/methodology/approach: An approach is proposed to measure data visibility’s total value using a multi-stage algorithm. A multi-objective mathematical optimization model is then developed to determine the optimal integrated purchasing plan in a multi-product setting under risk. The model contemplates three essential objective functions, i.e. maximizing total data quality and quantity level, minimizing purchasing risks and minimizing total costs. Findings: With emerging competitive areas, in the presence of industry 4.0, internet of things and big data, high data quality can improve the process of supply chain decision-making. This paper supports the managers for the procurement planning of modern organizations under risk and thus provides an in-depth understanding for the enterprises having the readiness for industry 4.0 transformation.

As a consequence the way businesses operate has changed dramatically. For example, the amount of data has grown exponentially. Companies are looking for ways to use this data to add value to their business. This has implications for the manner in which (financial) governance needs to be organized. The main purpose of this study is to obtain insight in the changing role of controllers in order to add value to the business by means of data analytics. To answer the research question a literature study was performed to establish a theoretical foundation concerning data analytics and its potential use. Second, nineteen interviews were conducted with controllers, data scientists and academics in the financial domain. Thirdly, a focus group with experts was organized in which additional data were gathered. Based on the literature study and the participants responses it is clear that the challenge of the data explosion consist of converting data into information, knowledge and meaningful insights to support decision-making processes. Performing data analyses enables the controller to support rational decision making to complement the intuitive decision making by (senior) management. In this way, the controller has the opportunity to be in the lead of the information provision within an organization. However, controllers need to have more advanced data science and statistic competences to be able to provide management with effective analysis. Specifically, we found that an important skill regarding statistics is the visualization and communication of statistical analysis. This is needed for controllers in order to grow in their role as business partner. © ECIAIR 2020.All right reserved.","Big data; Business controller; Data analytics; Decision support; Governance","Controllers; Data Analytics; Data Science; Decision support systems; Process control; Data driven decision; Decision making process; Effective analysis; Information provision; Literature studies; Rational decision making; Research questions; Theoretical foundations; Decision making",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097867522

Specifically, this research aims to assess the impact of ethical leadership as the independent variable on employees’ intention to stay as the dependent variable. In addition, the influence of employee rewards as mediator in these correlations is also examined. The survey was conducted among 138 Gen-Y employees currently employed in various MNCs in Penang, Malaysia. Data analysis is done via IBM SPSS for respondent profiling and SmartPLS for the construct variable analysis of goodness of data, reliability analysis, and the hypothesis testing of independent and mediating variables. The results show that the independent variable of ethical leadership has no positive correlation to the intention to stay of Gen-Y employees of MNCs in Penang, Malaysia. At the same time, the independent variable of employee rewards observes its dimension of pay and recognition (work appreciation) positively correlated to the dependent variable, while the dimension of promotion is surprisingly not. Accordingly, pay and recognition were found to mediate the relationship of ethical leadership to intention to stay. The subject of employee retention and turnover has been a common area of research in the field of social science, yet most of the studies have been done outside the Malaysian context. Further, most of the older studies have become irrelevant due to the dramatic demographical changes in the workforce, where the transition of the generation cohort has become more apparent in recent years. This study brings value in that the findings will close the gaps related to the dimensions proposed and is expected to help formulate a robust human capital retention strategy, critical to business sustainability. © 2020, International Journal of Business Science and Applied Management.

Different authors argue that the case study is a valid and advantageous research method for certain studies. For some authors this research method is an integrated system and offers the opportunity for a holistic view that combine data collection methods such as archival searches, interviews, questionnaires, and observation. The data collection needed to build a case study and the labor-intensive, can last months or even years, and data overload seems almost inevitable. The case study is an empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon within a real-life context. In this research method qualitative data usually predominates, but quantitative data often appears in case studies. Some research studies consider case study a research method to validate and construct theory. Other research highlights that all social science studies must start with a theory based on a review of the literature relating to the subject under investigation and this theory must then be validated through the study of a specific object, phenomenon or social problem. The key point is that before a theory can be validated, it must be constructed. In other words, a theory or theoretical framework first emerges through the inductive approach of studying an empirical case or object, not through a deductive process and finally all theories are initially based on a case or object. The present research focuses on the analysis of the methodological rigor of the defended master's dissertations. In this context were investigated master's theses in the management area of a higher education management institution that use a research method the case study. In order to achieve our goals, four hundred and forty-two master's dissertations defended in management scientific master's degrees in a Portuguese university higher education institution specialized in the area of economic and business sciences were analysed. The results of the qualitative research indicate that 40.0% of the dissertations focus on the case study. © 2020 Academic Conferences Limited.

In this context, Science Parks (SPs) are effective environments to promote new business based on technology and innovation. At the regional level, SPs are important for economic, social, and cultural development. As such, they promote new business and jobs, partnerships with universities and research centres, and attract new technology-based companies (NTBFs), which derive benefits from the spillovers that are generated. However, different regional realities and the varied motivations of the stakeholders explain the diversity among SPs. Accordingly, SPs arise and are governed through the cooperation of different types of stakeholders, such as academic, governmental, entrepreneurial and other agents and entities. Thus, they result from different interests and incentives that converge to their creation. A relevant approach to understand the specific engagement of different stakeholders in the creation of SPs and their respective roles is to study the context and circumstances of their formation. Starting from this point, the objective of this paper is to propose a SPs implementation framework based on cases from two countries - Brazil and Portugal. An investigation was laid down on 4 SPs in Brazil and 4 in Portugal through a comparative analysis methodology. Data collection occurred upon technical visits and, in complementarity, there was a documental approach on government websites, networks and associations and the SPs themselves. The results show that the main prerequisites for the formation of SPs are: A favourable environment with institutional stability, available knowledge, development business space and motivations that converge to a common purpose. As a theoretical contribution, the outcome of the research introduces the SPs implementation framework, emphasizing the main stakeholders and the fundamental prerequisites for their formation and development. As practical implications, the results can guide the design of a favourable institutional environment for the creation of SPs, enhancing the potential to produce good results such as innovation for the involved stakeholders and society, particularly at the level of companies. © 2020 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

Since ontologies are a machine-interpretable representation of enterprise knowledge and thus, not very adequate for human interpretation, we present a tool that combines the graphical and human interpretable representation of BMC with a business model ontology. The tool connects a business model with reusable data and interoperability to other intelligent business information systems so that additional functionalities are made possible, such as a comparison between business models. This research follows the design science strategy with a qualitative approach by applying literature research, expert interviews, and desk research. The developed AOAME4BMC tool consists of the frontend, a graphical web-based representation of an enhanced BMC, a web service for the data exchange with the backend, and a specific ontology for the machine-interpretable representation of a business model. The results suggest that the developed tool AOAME4BMC supports the suitability of an ontology-based representation for business model design. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Agile and ontology-aided meta-modeling; Business model canvas; Business model design; Ontology","Electronic data interchange; Interoperability; Turing machines; Visualization; Web services; Websites; Business information systems; Business model designs; Business modeling; Interpretable representation; Literature researches; Ontology-based representation; Qualitative approach; Web-based representation; Ontology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097085149

These principles are based on our research results regarding collaboration support in product costing as pilot domain. In this domain, we discovered a specific lack of integrated e-collaboration to enable communication, coordination, and information exchange in direct connection to the core processes with their daily work routines and data sources. In a design science research project, we created artefacts for the product costing domain and derived design principles for a broader scope of contexts. The design principles for BDSpeC illustrate how such an integration can be achieved in various business domains with similarities to product costing. By focusing on design principles, we have abstracted and codified design knowledge that is useful for both, research and practice. In design practice, the design knowledge can be used to develop other instances as solutions to a class of problems sharing similarities with product costing. In design research, it is intended to encourage exaptation by supporting the transfer of our solution into other domains.

Currently, one of the greatest challenges is the integration of the circular economy (CE) into real business practices. However, the link between these two ideas is not fully recognised, causing an interpretative dilemma. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to identify the relationships between the CE and Industry 4.0. For this purpose, we performed a systematic literature review and content analysis of selected articles indexed in Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and EBSCO. In total, 32 papers published during the period 2017–2020 were analysed. The findings show a one-way relationship, i.e., Industry 4.0 leads to a CE, and a two-way relationship, indicating synergy between these concepts. The key spheres of the CE in terms of Industry 4.0 are the recycle and reuse strategy applied in smart production and a sustainable supply chain. This study demonstrates the importance of company (micro) and industry (meso) levels as application areas. The most promising digitalisation tools of Industry 4.0 are the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data Analytics.

This liquidity emergency motivated start-ups struggling to find alternative financing sources different from conventional bank lending. Venture capital financing evolved as viable financial mechanisms to revive SMEs' performance. Aim: This article analysed the impact of venture capital financing on SMEs' performance in Uganda. This is the first empirical study that related and brought together the understanding of business entrepreneurs with those of venture capitalists. Setting: The rate of start-up business failure in Africa remains high, triggering an enormous threat to policy-makers and international development partners. Besides, the literature is diminutive, intermittent and fragmented to document venture capital performance. Methods: The study adopted a mixed-method and used survey questionnaires administered to 90 SMEs and complemented with data from semi-structured interviews. We used multiple regression analysis and correlation coefficient for data analysis generated from the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Results: Empirical evidence exhibited tremendous growth of venture-capital-backed companies in sales turnover, profitability and return on assets matched to the non-venturecapital-backed firms. Conclusion: This article presented the first extensive empirical study confirming evidence of venture capital financing for the enhancement of SMEs' performance and development in Uganda regarding revenue growth, profitability and return on assets. This study recommended to policy-makers and the business fraternity to develop policy frameworks tailored to the enhancement of the venture capital landscape growth. © 2020.

A salient link between education and business sector is a prerequisite to cater economically productive manpower. Economic and social development supplements each other that can only be ensured via a functional education system. A dysfunction education system created by a biased clustering policy develops a greater horizontal and vertical mismatch with the job market in many developing nations. This mismatch dents the quality of business management that halts the national prosperity. Therefore, the role of education has become questionable. This research aims to bridge between education and business sectors. Design/methodology/approach: Given the differentiated nature of research questions, multiple techniques are used to collect the data. However, this research bears the norms of qualitative method. Both secondary and primary data are used. While, secondary data are collected by the banks, Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics (BANBEIS) and by the University Grants Commission (UGC), primary data are collected through interviews. Document review and data collected through personal communication with members of staff of sampled banks and institutes of HE also supplements. Data were collected from six commercial banks and from the Central Bank. Findings: Findings suggest that clustering system favours science graduates by depriving business counterpart, which creates an atmosphere of educational disparity. This disparity affects the symbiotic and reciprocal relationship that exists amongst different provisions (i.e. secondaryand tertiary) of education. Favoured clustering system further contributes for a larger “horizontal educational mismatch” with job market. Therefore, science graduates occupy the places in the banks where business graduates should ideally be employed. Being a dysfunction system, education fails to support substantially for social and economic developments. Originality/value: A few studies are conducted in the area of HE in Bangladesh but none covers the issue of impact of clustering system of education in secondary provision on HE and job market. Graduates' performance in carrying out the jobs is seen as the most important element for the business management. This study has suggested a unique way forward which would be able to reduce the mismatch between education system and job market, enabling a substantial business management process. Considering this, the paper is first on its kind. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business education; Clustering education; Education and business; Horizontal and vertical mismatch; Job market",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090439919

The purpose of this study is to propose a process model for data-driven decision-making which provides an overarching methodology covering key stages of the business analytics life cycle. The model is then applied in two small enterprises using real customer/donor data to assist the strategic management of sales and fundraising. Design/methodology/approach: Data science is a multi-disciplinary subject that aims to discover knowledge and insight from data while providing a bridge to data-driven decision-making across businesses. This paper starts with a review of established frameworks for data science and analytics before linking with process modelling and data-driven decision-making. A consolidated methodology is then described covering the key stages of exploring data, discovering insights and making decisions. Findings: Representative case studies from a small manufacturing organisation and an independent hospice charity have been used to illustrate the application of the process model. Visual analytics have informed customer sales strategy and donor fundraising strategy through recommendations to the respective senior management teams. Research limitations/implications: The scope of this research has focused on customer analytics in small to medium-sized enterprise through two case studies. While the aims of these organisations are rather specific, they share a commonality of purpose for their strategic development, which is addressed by this paper. Originality/value: Data science is shown to be applicable in the business environment through the proposed process model, synthesising micro- and macro-solution methodologies and allowing organisations to follow a structured procedure.

Further, it highlights a range of experiments conducted at actual business sites to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies and theories. In modern society, food study has become more complex, as it involves multiple fields of science. For instance, a long-lived society entails a number of problems for human beings. A balanced intake of nutrients is important for a healthy life, but in many cases, healthy food is not the most enjoyable. As such, it is important for the food industry to provide foods that are both tasty and wholesome, based on the sciences of gastronomy and nutrition. Conventional food study proceeds along the lines of a specific field such as nutrition, agriculture, or gastronomy, though it should be conducted in an interdisciplinary manner. This book covers multifaceted research on food study to respond to today’s societal demands, based mainly on the natural and social sciences. It addresses a wide range of topics, including: food production management using mathematical modeling, operations research, and production engineering; evaluation of food products based on big data analysis; psychological experiments and ethnography; food products based on consumer behavior; organoleptic assessment and health improvement; design of physical dining environments using virtual reality, pedestrian debt recognition (human indoor position measuring), and observation of behavior. Reporting on and assessing many studies conducted at actual business locations, the book offers a unique and highly practical resource. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Data mining; Employee analysis; Ethnomethodology; Food study; Indoor positioning measurement; Integrate system design; Operations research; Process design; Service engineering; Value evaluation",,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089629861

On the other hand, researchers in this field recognise a lack of a systematic approach for applying management control models to help start-ups to succeed. This article aims to identify how start-ups use management control practices under an innovative approach. For the data collection, six workshops were held involving 91 entrepreneurs. The research suggests that start-ups use a great number of controls in relation to customer management, performance, employees, information systems, and risks. Furthermore, evidence was also found that the use of management control tools has become a priority for companies wishing to overcome challenges raised by the huge number of uncertainties faced by start-ups. The theoretical contributions of the model presented in this paper have mainly to do with the fact that management controls are implemented and used in different scopes of start-ups analysis. The practical implications put in evidence that control mechanisms can be formal or informal, adapting to a company's needs.

To construct the artifact, the work of Eysenck and Wilson (1975) was used. The methodological approach used was Design Science, as the present object of study is considered an information artifact and, as such, has functions of data processing, reducing entropy (vision of syntax), forming meaning (vision of representation), and achieving viability (vision of adaptation). To ensure the validity of the study, a sample of users made up of 30 organizational psychologists was used, selected by convenience. The results demonstrated that using the artifact allows to measure entrepreneurs’ degree of boldness, affording them greater assertiveness in choosing and structuring their business. The study has a number of implications for managerial practice since by using the artifact it is possible to measure an entrepreneur’s degree of boldness and allow more assertive choices and structuring of their business, all the while reducing the rate of micro and small businesses that die early. In the academic field, the artifact will enable research on the degree of boldness of businesspeople with diverse other organizational variables. © 2020, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

Although the execution of Analytics initiatives is similar across domains and similar issues occur, current literature offers little understanding of whether the investigation of aspects such as success factors, barriers, and management of Analytics must be domain-specific. This article investigates characteristics of the execution of Analytics initiatives that are distinct within domains and can guide future research collaboration and focus. The research was conducted on the example of Logistics and Supply Chain Management and the respective domain-specific Analytics subfield of Supply Chain Analytics. The field of Logistics and Supply Chain Management was recognized as an early adopter of Analytics, but has fallen back to a midfield position in comparison to other domains. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses Grounded Theory based on 12 semi-structured interviews, creating a map of domain characteristics based of the paradigm scheme of Strauss and Corbin. Findings: The study identified a total of 34 characteristics of Analytics initiatives that distinguish domains in the execution of initiatives, which are mapped and explained. As a blueprint for further research, the domain specifics of Logistics and Supply Chain Management are presented and discussed. Originality/value: The results of this research should stimulate cross-domain research on Analytics issues and prompt further research on the identified characteristics for a broader understanding of their impact on Analytics initiatives. The study also describes the status quo in Analytics. Further, the results can help managers to control the environment of Analytics initiatives and design more successful initiatives. © 2020, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

Descriptive approaches to understand business models are often based on the analysis of their components by looking at organizational assets, resources, plans, and competencies. Although there are numerous contributions in the literature, few guidelines are offered regarding an Activity System perspective, in a prescriptive rather than a descriptive way. In this study, we propose a pragmatic solution to help cover this literature gap and to extend on previous studies. A Design Science Research approach was adopted including a multicase study of four business companies we examined in order to create a method for business model analysis from an Activity System perspective. The resulting artefact of the study is illustrated with data from the empirical cases. Three analytical movements are described as well as prescribed: Dimensions analysis (i.e., business definition, customer segment, value proposition, profit logic, critical factors of value proposition, and Activity System); visual representation including illustrations of its Activity System; and competitive analysis including prospection for changes and innovations. Finally, the artefact is discussed in relation to its quality, utility, and usability. © 2020, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

The objective of this paper was to analyse the role of relevant stakeholders in participating in tourism as a catalyst for Local Economic Development in Coffee Bay. For the purpose of this study, both qualitative and quantitative research techniques were adopted. A questionnaire survey was utilized to collect data and Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyse data. The findings of this study indicates that there are entrepreneurial initiatives in Coffee Bay, however, these initiatives are seemingly not well managed due to poor education levels. The study also found that the community of Coffee Bay appear to be unsure of who owns the tourism businesses and who does not. In light of these findings the Wild Coast has not been fully utilized as a catalyst to bring about economic benefits to the local community. Therefore, it is envisaged that these findings will play a significant role in creating community awareness in Coffee Bay about tourism and its various benefits. It is recommended that entrepreneurial hubs be established in Coffee Bay in order to assist locals in managing their businesses. The limitation to this study was time. It had to be completed within a year and only focuses on Coffee Bay area not Wild Coast at large.

This research paper reports the results of the sentimental analysis done for a company’s competitors using software R Studio and Google Analytics. One Company is taken as a sample and its Competitor company’s keywords were extracted (the contents with hash tags), to find the ratio of positive: negative words used in their social media content. This crude information, in reality, is frequently untidy and ineffectively organized. But Tidy data makes it easy to carry out data analysis. The investigation included sophisticated natural-language-processing machine learning algorithms to parse the content by an individual's post in social media about the organization in understanding the importance behind every individual's statement. Those algorithms made a measurable score of the public's sentiments towards the organization dependent on social media interactions and offer reports to the top administration. People’s opinions (sentiments) were analyzed, grouping large variations of them into fewer categories, and formed patterns that are usually not noticed by the naked eye. Then, they were matched along with the positive and negative standards and the number of positive and negative words, their location, and their ratio was listed out. In simple terms, this research makes an organization’s insight much easier for understanding stakeholders and in decision making. © IJSTR 2020.","Data analytics; Google analytics; Sentimental Analysis; Social media; Tidy data",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081712848

Thus, this article seeks to study the business model from the concept of open innovation in public organizations. This theme has been the focus of few studies in the field of technological management. The central goal of the study is to evaluate how a public company manages its business model using open innovation. For this purpose, a single case study was conducted at EMBRAPA Forestry, which is a science and technology research unit for the commercial and noncommercial forestry sector. Seven semi-structured interviews, direct observation and document analysis were the data sources. The data were analyzed with the aid of Atlas.ti software. EMBRAPA is one of the main players in the field of agroforest research and is the principal Brazilian company responsible for RD&I in the tropical agriculture sector. The study contributes to the field through: a) the theoretical construction involving the business model and open innovation in public organizations; and b) original research that simultaneously analyzes the business model and open innovation in an important company in the agricultural sector with worldwide influence. The results show the importance of EMBRAPA to Brazilian agriculture in terms of science and technology, with a significant impact on national socio-economic development.

To this purpose, organizations have depended on qualitative expert judgment, but it has increasingly suffered from reduced sensitivity and accuracy. A better way of monitoring is needed. As either alternative or supplement to expert judgment, some researchers suggested various quantitative indicators including number of patents, number of new products and others. However, it is not clear what indicators are good for monitoring of emerging technologies, and how we can identify such indicators because each indicator has advantages as well as disadvantages. Therefore, in this paper, we suggest a method of identifying appropriate quantitative monitoring indicators for emerging technological opportunities. In the existing literature, appropriateness of monitoring indicators can be evaluated from three perspectives: 1) sensitivity to technological changes, 2) sensitivity to changes in external context, and 3) sensitivity to the value of a technological opportunity. In other words, good monitoring indicators send signals when important changes occur. Through literature review, we collect monitoring indicators and their time-series data of two emerging technologies over last nine years. Selected technologies consist of building-integrated photovoltaic module and photovoltaic module. Reviewing existing literature, we construct a pool of monitoring indicators. Using autoregression and correlation analysis, we can choose monitoring indicators that can explain the variance of value of a technological opportunity. Then, sensitivity analysis helps us identify indicators that are sensitive to changes in technology and context For emerging technologies, we find some indicators that are sensitive to more than 70% of changes in technology and external context, but are sensitive to less than 10% of noises. However, some indicators are sensitive to more than 90% of changes in either technology or external context, and therefore are useful to monitor a certain kind of changes. By using these results, we can create a sequential use of indicators to identify a specific change in either technology or external context, and then to identify a clear shift in both aspects.

A research conceptual model was produced to determine the relationships from that model. A quantitative research approach was utilised for this investigation and a simple random sampling procedure was embraced. The target population for this examination was confined to heads of marketing departments within manufacturing SMEs in the Gauteng province of South Africa. The data analysis was done in Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 25 for demographic data analysis and AMOS 25 was utilised for the structural equation modelling. The tested relationships produced satisfactory results consistent with how they were hypothesised. Unequivocally, it was discovered that green packaging and green advertising had a positive influence on competitive advantage and business performance. This investigation expands the knowledge base that presently exists in the field of green marketing, competitive advantage, as well as SMEs business performance. Likewise, this examination is important to manufacturing SME proprietors and supervisors since most them endeavour to have a competitive advantage and additionally, to boost profitability, as well as the business’ interest. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Analytics, once the purview of the data scientist, is now spread throughout organizations. No longer is there a single job title, job function, or set of required skills and credentials for an analytics career. Companies have moved away from seeking applicants with a specific degree to now recruiting analytics talent based on required skill sets. For more than a decade, business schools have been developing new programs in analytics in response to industry's needs. However, in developing meaningful career-ready professionals, business programs must understand the skills required across different analytics job functions. In this article, the authors present a comprehensive assessment of the skills sought by employers when considering a candidate for an entry-level analytics position. The authors describe the demand for various types of analytics professionals, identify the job titles and functions with the most significant demand, and then draw a comparison of the job requirements of hard skills, soft skills, software skills, and credentials between three of the most sought-after analytics areas: data science, data analytics, and business analytics. The authors conclude by providing faculty and administrators with recommendations on how to adapt their courses and programs to provide students with the fundamental preparation necessary for careers in data science, data analytics, and business analytics. © 2020 Decision Sciences Institute","Analytics; Content Areas; Technology and Innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079425899

Business Social Responsibility (BSR) is a way a business can contribute to the society in which it operates and invest in the well-being of its stakeholders, as well as improving the quality of the workforce and local community. Tourism businesses specifically within the hospitality sector engage in BSR programs with initiatives such as to employ local residents and sponsor local schools, but many communities are unaware of these initiatives. The lack of knowledge about BSR programs have attributed to communities being unaware of the benefits of having hotels within their communities. The objective of the study is to determine the level of community's awareness on hotels BSR initiatives in East London. The data collection method that was used is primary and secondary data which was gained through self-administered questionnaire. The study included both primary and secondary data collection methods. A total number of 100 questionnaires were distributed among the community residents in Quigney. The data was captured and analysed using Statistical Packaging for Social Science (SPSS) software. The main findings of the study revealed that a large majority of the local community members in Quigney, East London were unaware of hotels that practise BSR. Therefore, the mandate lies with the hotel managers of Quigney to increase knowledge within the community about their BSR programmes so that the community can be aware of such positive initiatives. The study aimed to contribute to the growing literatue on community awareness in the Eastern Cape.

The paper explains the elements of an activity system (the subject, object, outcome, mediating tools, rules, community and division of labour). Thereafter, practical examples from the work of two recent PhD students are used to show the importance of identifying and analysing activities that are found either in the introduction or the current use of information systems in business organisations. These examples highlight the applicability of Activity Theory in analysing data from projects of interest to Business Management whose topics and contexts are very different. The first focusses on the introduction of an Accounting Information System to microbusinesses in a low-income community in South Africa and the second focusses on Information Security Management in Mobile Network Organisations in Uganda. The examples illustrate the value of Activity Theory as a lens and as a way of stimulating critical analysis. Activity Theory is known for its ability to identify reasons for failure or disappointing performance in existing situations by highlighting contradictions either between different activities, between an earlier version of an activity and a later version as the activity evolves, or within an activity (between the elements of that activity). However, as shown in the first example, it can also be seen as a useful tool when proposing a new project as a predictor of success. Despite the fact that data is typically qualitative, the analytical process related to Activity Theory can be structured, which assists novice researchers or those unaccustomed to interpretivist analysis to uncover insights that are not immediately obvious. Activity Theory is said to act as a lens in data analysis and is particularly useful in organisational sciences for the theorization of technology-mediated organizational change. © ACPIL.","Accounting information systems; Activity theory; Analysis of qualitative data; Case study; Contradictions; Information security management; Participative action research; Technology-mediated organisational change",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081667996

Such advanced solutions require data scientists with rare (and generally expensive) skill sets. Moreover, such solutions are often perceived as complex black boxes to decision-makers. Automated machine learning tools aim to reduce the expertise gap between the technical teams and stakeholders involved in business data science projects, by reducing the amount of time and specialized skills required to generate predictive models. We systematically benchmarked five automated machine learning tools against seven supervised learning problems of a business nature. Our results suggest that such tools, in fully automated mode, must be used cautiously, only where predictive models support low-impact decisions and do not need to be explainable, and only by data scientists capable to ensure that all phases of the data mining process have been performed adequately. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Augmented analytics; Automated machine learning; Data science; Decision making; Decision support; Industry; Supervised learning","Advanced Analytics; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Data mining; Data Science; Decision making; Decision support systems; Industry; Nonprofit organization; Supervised learning; Augmented analytics; Automated machines; Data mining process; Decision supports; Non profit organizations; Predictive models; Science projects; Supervised learning problems; Learning systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080952534

For the individual scholar, this may lead to serious conflicts when working on joint university–industry projects. Differences in goals, such as the university’s aim to disseminate knowledge while industry aims to appropriate knowledge, might lead to complicated situations and conflicts of interest. The detailed cases of two electrical engineers and two architects working at two different universities of technology illustrate the kinds of problems individual scholars face in university–business collaborations. These cases are based on qualitative interviews and additional data and demonstrate that, while value conflicts emerge on the organizational level, it is primarily the individual researcher who must deal with such conflicts. This analysis adds to existing studies in two ways: first, it explicitly addresses normative issues framed in terms of ethical and social values, thereby going beyond the common social-science perspective of university–business collaboration. Secondly, it provides qualitative insights, thereby identifying details and issues not apparent in quantitative studies. In particular, it is evident that university–industry collaborations are prone to value conflicts not only in research but also in education and job training. © 2019, The Author(s).","Academics; Universities of technology; University–industry collaborations; Value conflicts; Values","architecture; commercial phenomena; conflict of interest; cooperation; engineering; ethics; human; industry; knowledge; motivation; personnel; research ethics; science; social psychology; technology; university; vocational education; Architecture; Commerce; Conflict of Interest; Cooperative Behavior; Education, Professional; Engineering; Ethics; Ethics, Research; Goals; Humans; Industry; Knowledge; Research Personnel; Science; Social Values; Technology; Universities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074592853

Thus, process deviance is an essential topic of BPM research and practice. Today, research on process deviance is mainly driven from a computer science perspective. IT-based methods and tools (e.g., deviance mining and prediction or compliance checking) detect process deviance by comparing log data from past process instances with normative process models or execution traces of currently running instances. However, requiring process models and event logs as input, existing approaches are expensive and limited to processes executed in automated workflow environments. Further, they can only detect process deviance, not explain why it occurs. Thus, knowledge about reasons for process deviance is immature. What is missing is a systematic exploration of reasons for process deviance. Against this backdrop, we compiled and structured reasons for process deviance based on a rating-type Delphi study with more than 30 experts from industry and academia. Thereby, we chose a process manager’s perspective as analytical lens, as process managers are familiar with and responsible for business processes end-to-end. We also analyzed the reasons’ importance for causing deviance in routine and nonroutine processes, two process types that capture the nature of processes in terms of variation and variety. Our results contribute to the descriptive knowledge on process deviance and serve as foundation for prescriptive research. © 2018, The Author(s).","Business process management; Delphi study; Process deviance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074196520

Response rates have typically been low, making non-response bias a potential threat to the validity of some of these studies’ results. Meanwhile, the availability of large publicly-available datasets continues to grow and methods of text mining and linking databases continue to improve. By linking NIGMS grant funding records, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office data, and business intelligence databases, we explored innovation, commercialization and survival for recipients of NIGMS SBIR/STTR funding. In doing so, we were able to more completely assess several key outcomes of the NIGMS SBIR/STTR program.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether RT data processing reduces SCM uncertainties under real-world conditions.

In total, 14 prospective statements concerning RT data processing in SCM operations were developed and evaluated by 68 SCM and data-science experts. Findings: RT data processing was found to have an ambivalent influence on the reduction of SCM complexity and associated uncertainty. Analysis of the data collected from the study participants revealed a new type of uncertainty related to SCM data itself.

Disparities identified in citation comparison studies have also led to disagreement about the value of the higher number of citations for social sciences and business scholarly articles consistently reported by GS. The purpose of this paper is to extend previous database citation comparison studies by manually analyzing a sample of unique GS citations to a leading operations management journal (i.e. citations found only in GS and not the commercial search engines) to reveal just where these additional citations are coming from. Design/methodology/approach: In addition to comparing citation counts for the three databases, unique GS citation data for the sample of journal articles was manually captured and reviewed. The authors’ approach provides a much more in-depth examination of the provenance of GS citations than is found in previous studies. Findings: The findings suggest that concerns about the value of unique GS citations may not be warranted since the document types for the unique GS citing documents identified in the analysis are dominated by familiar scholarly formats. Predominantly authentic and validated journal publications, dissertations, conference papers, and book and book chapters accounted for the large majority of the unique GS citations analyzed. Practical implications: The study lends further credence to contentions that the use of citations reported in GS is appropriate for evaluating research impact in disciplines where other formats beyond the English-language journal article are valued. Originality/value: Developing a more informed understanding of the provenance of unique GS citations in the authors’ field is important because many scholars not only aspire to publish in elite journals with high impact factors based on citation counts provided by commercial databases to demonstrate quality, but also report the larger number of citations for their publications that are reported by GS to demonstrate impact. The in-depth manual analysis suggests that GS provides a more nuanced and comprehensive representation of research impact and international scope than the commercial databases. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","North America; Performance measurements; Process management; Survey",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073936184

Design/methodology/approach: The target population of this study consisted of 530 managers and experts in knowledge-based firms in Science and Technology Parks of Isfahan (Iran), which were active in the electronics and electronic engineering, bio, renewable energy, nano and information and communication technologies. To determine the effects of the social media and networking capability on the commercialization performance in knowledge-based firms, this study collected the data through a questionnaire survey with knowledge-based firms and conducted statistical analysis. The unit of analysis is the entire firm. The random sampling method was applied in this study. This study mainly uses the validated existing scales of previous studies on Likert-type scales with response options ranging from 1 to 5. To increase the response rate and accuracy, the researchers in this study also conducted phone and e-mail survey. A total of 230 questionnaires were conducted to remove the questionnaires with inadequate or missing answers, and the final 220 cases were selected as valid samples. Findings: First, this research confirmed that social media usage can positively improve commercialization performance. Second, this research confirmed the mediating role of the networking capability on the relationship between social media usage and commercialization performance. In fact, social media tools represent a potential vehicle to help firms create better relationships with partners and increase commercialization performance via these mechanisms. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing literature by integrating the domains of social media usage and business networks perspective. Social media has revolutionized the way firms interact with business partners. A salient characteristic of today’s business setting is that partners use social media to nurture and sustain their network relationships with others (Kim et al., 2016). Moreover, based on the dynamic capability theory and business networks perspective, the authors introduce the impression management capability as a networking capability dimension that has been neglected and mentioned only briefly. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business networks; Commercialization; Commercialization performance; Networking capability; Social media usage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074330956

This article re-examines the relationship paradigm in public relations and marketing in an online environment. By means of a systematic review, it seeks to explicate communicative relationships between organizations and their diverse stakeholders, to review how they are operationalized and measured, and to illuminate their normative evaluations. This conceptual specification is guided by systematic sampling and content analysis of all primary research on organization-stakeholder relationships in the broader social sciences. Results of a comprehensive analysis of 74 articles suggest that studies overemphasize the business contexts, follow an instrumental orientation based on transactions rather than communication, and lack analyses of digital data.

This study aims to identify the dynamics that encourage entrepreneurial attitudes among women in MENA countries. More precisely, it required to scrutinize the role of the government, role models, the entrepreneurial training and women’s demographic characteristics in encouraging women to embrace entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on primary data, where data were gathered from a sample of 300 women from MENA countries through a self-administered questionnaire and were subjected to one-way ANOVA tests. Different statistical tools were used to draw some valued conclusions from the gathered data. The study reveals that women entrepreneurs acknowledge the role played by the government, entrepreneurship training, role models and demographic variables in encouraging them to embrace entrepreneurship. Findings: The government and the entrepreneurial training were found to be the greatest variables encouraging women to embrace entrepreneurship. Nevertheless, the low overall mean exhibited that most women do not believe that these bodies have played their role satisfactorily. Whereas the ANOVA results reveal that age and work experience were not important dynamics behind encouraging women to embrace entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications: Data were collected from a sample of 300 women entrepreneurs with a simple random sampling technique from the following MENA countries: Oman, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. It is too difficult to approach the women respondents and then collect data from them especially in MENA countries; hence the sample is small and limited. Practical implications: However, such studies are still in the minority, and, with few exceptions, most have been published in the niche. The study finds imperative for policymakers to go beyond measures that aim to address the challenges that individual women entrepreneurs face and to study the institutional framework affecting women entrepreneurship in relationship to motivations and resources. Additional care is desired to compel the environment and context to eliminate barriers to women entrepreneurship at source. The government should play a significant role in encouraging women to embrace entrepreneurship, especially in times of economic slowdown. World-wide, women are under-represented among the population of entrepreneurs, and they tend to have different motivations and intentions. The first, and most obvious, implication highlights governments need to create special funds for unlocking the potential by enhancing their levels of entrepreneurship skills using the traditional instruments such as training. The government should come up with new and specific training programmes, providing support for growth-oriented women entrepreneurs with dedicated business incubator and business accelerator programmes. Social implications: Entrepreneurs are strongly influenced by role models and social context. It is therefore important to promote women entrepreneurs as role models and ensure that the education system is gender-neutral and does not discourage women from going into different fields. Finally, more targeted actions can be taken to ensure that family policies, social policies and tax policies do not discriminate against entrepreneurship by women. Originality/value: The author believes that only few entrepreneurship researchers are interested in feminist epistemology, disappointingly the more advanced understanding of feminism witnessed in sociology and the political science literature is not reflected in the field of entrepreneurship. Hence, there is a need for investigate the dynamics like government role, entrepreneurial training, role models and demographic characteristics, to have a fuller understanding of how they affect, to ensure a more accurate assessment of the outcomes for the development of women entrepreneurs in MENA countries. This study is an attempt to investigate the dynamics such as government role, entrepreneurial training, role models and demographic characteristics that encourage women to embrace entrepreneurship in MENA countries. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurial encouragement; Entrepreneurship training; MENA countries; Role models; Women entrepreneurship",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074108452

Design/methodology/approach: A multilayer network is created from data collected through a consumer survey to identify customers’ choices in seven different markets. The authors focus the analysis on a smaller kinship and cohabitation network and apply the LART network community detection algorithm. To verify the association between consumers’ centrality and variables related to their respective socioeconomic profile, the authors develop an econometric model to measure their impact on consumer’s degree centrality. Findings: Based on 595 responses analysing individual consumers, the authors find out which consumers invest and which variables influence consumers’ centrality. Using a smaller sample of 70 consumers for whom they know kinship and cohabitation relationships, the authors detect communities with the same consumption patterns and verify that this may be an adequate way to establish co-marketing strategies. Originality/value: Network analysis has become a widely used technique in the extraction of knowledge on consumers. This paper’s main (and novel) contribution lies in providing a greater understanding on how multilayer networks represent hidden databases with potential knowledge to be considered in business decisions. Centrality and community detection are crucial measures in network science which enable customers with the highest potential value to be identified in a network. Customers are increasingly seen as multidimensional, considering their preferences in various markets. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Centrality; Co-marketing; Community detection; Multilayer networks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073678334

Particularly, we propose the Cross Industry Standard Process for Electronic Social Network Platforms (CRISP-eSNeP) not only as an extension to the CRISP-DM model, but also as an advancement of the knowledge on KDDM methods.

Recent studies have argued that energy sector transition is both a technological and a social phenomenon that needs to be looked at from more holistic and comparative perspectives. The cognitive construction view of industry shows promise in opening up the role of managerial cognition and social construction in this regard. The cognitive construction view of industry suggests that the collective changes in firms' beliefs about market boundaries drive development of the industry. Drawing on this view, we investigate cleantech firms' shared beliefs about the key technologies to recognize development patterns in the collective strategy frames and propose an approach to capture the emergence and development of the industry. For this purpose, the study analyzes longitudinal data collected from the annual reports of the incumbent firms operating within the cleantech industry. The results of the study found two sequentially developing phases in industry-level belief structures regarding renewable energy, sustainability, and digitalization as the key technology areas among the firms. In addition, it was possible to trace the differences between the firms’ beliefs about technology development to their different social networks. Thus, the findings suggest that the cognitive construction view of industry provides an opportunity to shed light on the complex dynamics of energy transition and envision industry development within the fast-changing industry conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cleantech industry; Cognition; Digitalization; Energy transition; Renewable energy; Sustainability","Digital storage; Energy policy; Social sciences computing; Sustainable development; CleanTech; Cognition; Digitalization; Energy transitions; Renewable energies; Planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067548772

In this scenario, it is imperative that organizations use Intelligence, which is understood as a process of gathering, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating high-value data and information at the right time for use in the decision-making process. Earlier, the concept of Intelligence was associated with the military and national security sector; however, in present times, and as organizations evolve, Intelligence has been defined in several ways for the purposes of different applications. Given that the purpose of Intelligence is to obtain real value from data, information, and the dynamism of the organizations, the study of this discipline provides an opportunity to analyze the core trends related to data collection and processing, information management, decision-making process, and organizational capabilities. Therefore, the present study makes a conceptual analysis of the existing definitions of intelligence in the literature by quantifying the main bibliometric performance indicators, identifying the main authors and research areas, and evaluating the development of the field using SciMAT as a bibliometric analysis software. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Business Intelligence; Competitive Intelligence; Mapping analysis; Science information management; Strategic Intelligence","Competition; Competitive intelligence; Data acquisition; Data handling; Military applications; National security; Bibliometric analysis; Competitive position; Decision making process; Mapping analysis; Organizational capabilities; Performance indicators; Products and services; Strategic intelligence; Decision making",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060769765

By completing semi-structured questionnaires, the 135 respondents generated the quantitative data, which was analysed utilising Version 25 of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. The results revealed that the conventional internal controls which are customary in larger business enterprises were either absent or not adequately implemented in the SMEs. A cross-gender comparison suggested that female-led SMEs were more likely to implement internal control systems than their male counterparts. By empirically justifying the need for internal control systems in SMEs, this paper contributes to both theory and practice, by reaffirming the effectiveness of internal controls and emphasising how their effective implementation can increase the sustainability of this business cohort. © 2019 by author(s).","Internal controls; Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073202177

That is, the higher the SCM, the lower the demand for CM, and the lower the SCM, the higher the demand for CM. Furthermore, the study shows the importance of SCM as compared with CM in healthcare facilities. Design/methodology/approach: This study investigated 28 services in facility engineering services for an exploratory study by using the open-ended approach of the grounded theory. Five years of data with a total of 20,480 SCM work orders and 84,837 CM work orders were extracted from the central management information system database. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences program. Data were presented in the form of mathematical scores using descriptive statistics and correlation test to elaborate the variable characteristics and make conclusions. Findings: This study provides empirical insights about the effectiveness of proactive maintenance in reducing breakdowns for systems or equipment in health-care facilities. Findings suggest that increasing SCM will reduce CM demands. Research limitations/implications: The location approach, with restrictions to the comparison between CM and SCM, still allows for exploration, especially on the factors that can reduce the demand for correction. These factors include planned preventive maintenance, work flow process, level of competency of maintenance workers and health-care maintenance strategic planning. Practical implications: Proactive maintenance is important in preventing dangerous occurrences in hospitals. Reducing breakdowns increases customer satisfaction. Therefore, this study shows implications to health-care maintenance organizations in the context of business strategic development. Originality/value: Data are crucial in proving a hypothesis. This study confirms the evidence of facility management demand theory and highlights the inverse relationship between SCM and CM. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Asset management; Best practice; Building maintenance; Business strategy; Customer satisfaction; Facility management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071561608

It is imperative to incorporate a wide audience of user requirements in the development process to design successful information systems (IS). Hence, requirements elicitation (RE) is increasingly performed by end-users that are novices at contributing requirements to IS development projects. [Objective] We need to develop RE systems that are capable of assisting a wide audience of end-users in communicating their needs and requirements. Prominent methods, such as elicitation interviews, are challenging to apply in such a context, as time and location constraints limit potential audiences. [Research Method] The presented dissertation project utilizes design science research to develop a requirements self-elicitation system, LadderBot. A conversational agent (CA) enables end-users to articulate needs and requirements on the grounds of the laddering method. The CA mimics a human interviewer's capability to rephrase questions and provide assistance in the process and allows users to converse in their natural language. Furthermore, the tool will assist requirements analysts with the subsequent aggregation and analysis of collected data. [Contribution] The dissertation project makes a practical contribution in the form of a ready-to-use system for wide audience end-user RE and subsequent analysis utilizing laddering as cognitive elicitation technique.

The readiness of countries, including South Africa (SA), and whether and how they have prepared, planned and organised for this revolution, offers little empirical research. To date, no clarity exists with regards to social re-skilling, infrastructural adjustments, technology up scaling, and human resource readiness, as well as economic re-capitalisation. This study aims at providing input to assist with closing this research gap, seeking understanding and knowledge around creative methodologies for 4IR in SA, and the extent of perceived readiness and various factors confronting the country’s readiness in the coming industrial revolution. The study population consisted of 287 participants from seven selected business areas in the province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN, SA. The target population was determined by quota sampling method, while the measuring instrument was a 3-point Likert-scaled questionnaire, designed and personally administered to respondents, allowing 10 days for completion. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 24.0) was used for data analysis and research findings presented in tables. The study highlighted that many respondents do not believe SA is ready for 4IR. The findings of this research should be used with care, as the sample is very small; the study recommends further empirical studies with larger numbers, which will include other provinces. © 2019, Allied Business Academies.

There are competitions in delivering better management, better quality of evaluations and better services in the market. The only possible way to meet all these qualities is to conduct analysis of data with purity and more accurately. Machine learning is the emerging field to predict future outcomes with existing data and based on these predictions better decisions can be made. Cricket is a well-known game that played and watched around a globe in 104 countries. Many of these cricket fans want their team to perform good and declare as a winner. To make sure their team’s win, team should work on their strengths and team performances. Predicting winner of a cricket match depends on many factors like batsman’s performances, team strengths, venues and weather conditions etc. In this research various features have been analyzed to predict the match winner of the game. This research paper is about prediction of an IPL match winner before the match started. The winner of IPL is predicted by training machine learning models on the selected features. For this purpose of model building, different machine learning algorithms has been applied on test and training datasets of different sizes which are Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree. The prediction model will have benefits for cricketing boards like evaluating the team’s strength and cricket analysis.

First, we find that science-based KIBS firms (those engaged in a science, technology, and innovation [STI] mode of organizational learning), like science-based manufacturing firms, are active collaborators with universities for innovation. This relationship is further enhanced if these firms also provide highly customized services. Second, in contrast to the existing literature suggesting that firms engaged in a doing, using, and interacting (DUI) mode of organizational learning do not regard collaboration with universities as important for their innovation, we find that KIBS firms engaged in a DUI mode of organizational learning and offering highly customized services are active collaborators with universities for innovation, despite the fact that they may not possess highly formalized scientific knowledge.

In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for putting at use this variety of Big Data sources, with a unified approach that applies spatial and temporal analysis over heterogeneous streams of data. We define spatial analysis based on conceptual grids (made of cells) over the city space, and then we study: the time series of signals both at grid and cell level; the correlation across signals and across cells; the prediction of city dynamics based on multiple signals; and the identifications of anomalies based on the difference between the observed dynamics and their prediction. To implement this model we propose a general architectural framework that uses Big Data technologies (such as HDFS, YARN, HIVE, PIG, Cascalog, Spark, Spark SQL, Spark Streaming and SparkR) and can be deployed in different configurations based on different needs. By taking an inherent data science approach to the problem we are able to address at scale: technical problems such as heterogeneous time and space granularity of the data, as well as appropriate interpretation of the results through tools that enable intuitive and immediate visual perception of emerging patterns and dynamics. We demonstrate feasibility, generality and effectiveness of our Urban Data Science at scale approach through multiple use cases and examples taken from real-world requirements collected in various cities and accounting for diverse business and city needs. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Behavioural Analytics; Big Data; Smart City; Social Media; Urban Computing; Urban Sensing","Dynamics; Smart city; Social networking (online); Spatial variables measurement; Time series analysis; Behavioral analytic; Conceptual frameworks; Data-source; Physical sensors; Sensing technology; Social media; Socio-economics; Unified approach; Urban computing; Urban sensing; Big data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046685450

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a process design in such environments via configurable process reference modelling, using airports as an example. Design/methodology/approach: Existing reference modelling methods around process modelling, merging and configuration are extended to include contextual and spatial factors using the design science methodology. The approach is empirically based on a set of business process management notation (BPMN) models for international passenger departures, consolidated from five Australian airport case studies via document analysis, interviews and observation. Findings: The use of contextual factors and operational scenarios, structured using the proposed approach, facilitated efficient cross-organisational comparison for configuring processes to suit the needs of a target organisation. The resulting configurable model integrates the perspectives of organisational stakeholder groups with that of the customer in a transparent and unambiguous graphical representation. It is a reusable tool with low data collection needs for each use. Research limitations/implications: Future research should include: version management; how to keep the model current; configurability via modelling objects other than gateways; and cross-discipline application (e.g. as a foundation for quantitative decision-making models). Originality/value: This is the first reported application of configurable reference modelling to airport passenger facilitation. Methodological contributions include the addition of space-sensitive process elements and notation to BPMN; guidelines for systematically deriving contextual factors associated with process variants across similar organisations; and overall normative guidelines for inductively developing a configurable process reference model. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Airport passenger facilitation/flow; BPMN; Business Process Management; Configurable reference model; Contextual factors; Process configuration; Process merging; Space-sensitive process model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056997011

The article then argues that Active Citation is the right variant of Open Data for the business–history community and that the widespread adoption of Active Citation in the field of business history would be promoted by the creation of a specialised repository for business–historical research data. The challenges involved in establishing such a repository are discussed.

In this review science mapping techniques were applied to review 146 SCOPUS indexed articles and conference papers concerned with the implementation of DBM. Digitization and its rapid evolution are creating new products, changing customer demands and disrupting traditional markets. Hence, the focus of many companies up to date has been on the adoption of emergent technologies, such as internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence, big-data or cloud computing. Yet in order to stay competitive and to avoid disruption by a new market entrant a firm needs to adapt and even redesign its core business model in the context of the digital age. However, successfully implementing a digital business model remains one of today's most challenging tasks. The aim of this review is to reveal the size, growth trajectory and geographic distribution of the digital business model knowledge base. Moreover, the goal is to detect key journals, authors and publications, as well as to give an overview of the intellectual structure of the literature and possibly highlight actual trends in the domain of DBM. The review attested a modest-sized knowledge base concentrated in Western countries. Furthermore, four 'schools of thoughts' were identified and further explained. It is a first attempt of a bibliometric review in this field, and thus shall give guidance for future research and practical implications. © 2019 PICMET.",,"Commerce; Geographical distribution; Intelligent systems; Internet of things; Conference papers; Emergent technologies; Growth trajectories; Intellectual structures; Internet of Things (IOT); Mapping techniques; Traditional markets; Western countries; Knowledge based systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073933028

Every day, the world is producing around 2.5 quintillion bytes of data. According to IDC, by 2020, over 40 zettabytes of data will be generated and reproduced. Digital data have become a deluge, overwhelming in every field of information technology (IT), business, science and engineering. These fields are shifting to smart and advanced technologies such as smart manufacturing industries, data-aware medical sciences, and other smart applications. These applications are facilitating the industries in context of data-driven decision making, big data storage, and complex analysis of large data sets. Also, these applications are contributing to generate big data deluge where a variety of data necessitate the industries to use advanced IT approaches. 95% of the digital universe is unstructured data. It is rich data as it contains information that can play a vital role to improve big data analytics. The heterogeneity, complexity, lack of structured information, poor quality and scalability of unstructured data generates difficulties in adapting traditional information extraction techniques. Information extraction can play a vital role in transformation of unstructured data into useful information. A multistep pipeline with data preprocessing steps, extraction methods and representation are utmost requirement to improve the unstructured data analytics. In this regard, this paper presents a short review of information extraction process w.r.t. input data type, extraction methods with their corresponding techniques, and representation of extracted information. The issues with unstructured data and the challenges to information extraction from multifaceted unstructured big data as well as the future research directions have also been discussed. © BEIESP.","Big data; Information extraction; Unstructured data; Unstructured data analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073475484

While social entrepreneurship is not a new phenomenon, the field has experienced significant growth over the past 15 years, either when applied to social problem-solving in a traditional way, or focused on private-sector entrepreneurship and large-scale transformation. However, there is still a lack of scientific review papers examining various government regulatory mechanisms, implemented on different government levels for stimulating social entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship ecosystems. This study aims to analyze the state-of-the-art of social entrepreneurship and its relation with government and key non-state actors. Following Pittaway et al. (2014) and Cerchione et al. (2018), a systematic literature review was carried out using the Scopus database, covering the period from 2001 up to 20th of March 2018, which resulted in a corpus of 478 scientific articles. The papers were ranked by the number of citations, according to the Web of Science® database, from which were selected the 102 most representative works. The abstracts of these selected studies were organized and submitted into an analysis of content via the 2015 edition of Alceste® software. Following the reading of all sources, the papers were classified and a matrix of data was produced, which allowed the descriptive analysis. The results show that there are at least six levels of government intervention to facilitate the development of social entrepreneurship. It also identified 4 directions taken by the government in support of social entrepreneurship, and 11 regulatory mechanisms, both of which could be deepened in future studies. The role of key non-state actors in the social entrepreneurship field has also been discussed. Based on the study, a future research agenda on the topic has been defined in the following directions: (i) a combination and coordination of regulatory mechanisms for better stimulation of social entrepreneurship, (ii) government policy oriented to the whole social entrepreneurship ecosystem, (iii) social capital, (iv) business models for social entrepreneurship ecosystems and government support. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cooperation; Government; Non-state actors; Social entrepreneurship; Systematic literature review","Ecosystems; Problem solving; Cooperation; Government; Non state actors; Social entrepreneurship; Systematic literature review; Economic and social effects",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064451790

An essential component of an organisation’s cybersecurity strategy is building awareness and education of online threats and how to protect corporate data and services. This programme is based on existing research and provides a unique insight into an ongoing city-based project with similar aims. Design/methodology/approach: To structure this work, a scoping review was conducted of the literature in cybersecurity education and awareness, particularly for SMEs/SMBs. This theoretical analysis was complemented using a case study and reflecting on an ongoing, innovative programme that seeks to work with these businesses to significantly enhance their security posture. From these analyses, best practices and important lessons/recommendations to produce a high-level programme for cybersecurity education and awareness were recommended. Findings: While the literature can be informative at guiding education and awareness programmes, it may not always reach real-world programmes. However, existing programmes, such as the one explored in this study, have great potential, but there can be room for improvement. Knowledge from each of these areas can, and should, be combined to the benefit of the academic and practitioner communities. Originality/value: The study contributes to current research through the outline of a high-level programme for cybersecurity education and awareness targeting SMEs/SMBs. Through this research, literature in this space was examined and insights into the advances and challenges faced by an on-going programme were presented. These analyses allow us to craft a proposal for a core programme that can assist in improving the security education, awareness and training that targets SMEs/SMBs. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Awareness; Cybersecurity; Education; Skills; Small-to-medium-sized businesses (SMBs); Small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)","Computers; Education; Awareness; Cyber security; Medium-sized business; Skills; Small to medium-sized enterprise; Computer science",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067037130

Here the basic problems are to find R&D's results and/or teams for solving the professional tasks and for making investment. But business has no personal view on scientific problems. So business is seeking the objective tools for forecasting and evaluation of R&D prospects and results. Experts have own interests and require a lot of funding. R&D reflections are the texts. The modern methods of computer analysis of texts can do a lot of the experts' work for making it more objective and cheaper. The tools for search, systematization and ranking R&D's results and teams are computer analysis of texts and the map of science. The map of science is the distribution of the collection of texts of a scientific nature by the topics. The map of science is a way to navigate through the world of scientific publications and R&D's teams, a tool for identifying trends and assessing R&D directions. The usual ways for the map of science formation use bibliometric/scientometric data, general probability models of the texts, expert's opinion or artificial intelligence (AI) models and methods based on the thesaurus or on the ontology of the subject domains. The interests of business are not in line with the orientation on a priori established ideas about possible topics or there number for rapidly changing scientific fields. Precisely these fields are of the greatest interest to business. On the basis of mathematical modeling of texts and large-scale text collections, an approach is proposed for the computational formation of the adaptive dynamic map of science that does not use a priori classification schemes and data of the scientific publications' citation. Topics (thematic groups), their number and the distribution of texts over the topics are determined computationally without experts' involvement. Examples of the maps of science for various collections of scientific publications are given. The original method is proposed for checking the adequacy of the text models and the map of science. The method uses the categorization of articles and their abstracts as the separate objects on the basis of computationally generated map (its topics). The results of the large-scale experiment confirmed the high efficiency of the proposed mathematical modeling of texts and text collections. The possibilities of practical use of the map of science for business applications are considered. © 2019 IEEE.","analytical support; collection; information retrieval; interpretation; modeling; research and development; semantics; semiotics; text","Artificial intelligence; Information retrieval; Models; Refuse collection; Semantics; Semiotics; Artificial intelligence tools; Business applications; Classification scheme; interpretation; Large scale experiments; Research and development; Scientific publications; text; Text processing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072049216

IBM predicts demand for data scientists will soar 28% By 2020. Forbes; NeSmith, 2018. The cybersecurity gap is an industry crisis. Forbes). In a recent survey with over 3,000 CIOs, 65% indicated their organizations were unable to maintain par with the progression of technology in areas such as data analytics and security due to a lack of adequate talent (Harvey Nash & KPMG, 2018. CIO survey 2018). Although, organizations have recently started to expand their talent pipeline following a neurological breakthrough: research as well as anecdotal evidence suggests adults with mild forms of autism display above-average intelligence, increased attention focus, and high visual-spatial abilities; a combination in high market demand for roles such as software testing, data analysis, cybersecurity, and engineering due to their uncanny ability with pattern recognition, information processing, analytics, and attention to detail. These auspicious developments come at the helm of an increasing rate of governments around the world implementing provisions to their labour regulations towards equitable hiring of people with disabilities (Myors et al., 2017. Perspectives from 22 countries on the legal environment for selection. Handbook of Employee Selection. 659-677. Research Collection Lee Kong Chian School of Business.). Some, such as France, Japan, Kenya, Korea, and Taiwan, have gone so far as to set quota targets (Myors et al., 2017. Perspectives from 22 countries on the legal environment for selection. Handbook of Employee Selection. 659-677. Research Collection Lee Kong Chian School of Business.). The implication for organizations is that they need to develop disability-inclusive recruitment and selection systems along with work designs and environments that are disability friendly. But what does this mean in practice? What does a disability-inclusive recruitment and selection system look like? Enter DXC Technology (DXC): born out of a merger between global conglomerate Computer Science Corporation and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, generating close to 25 billion annually in revenue, with clients across more than 70 countries, they strategically became a pioneer in the digital transformation that was taking place globally. In the wake of the breakthrough in employment diversity, DXC recognized this as an opportunity to gain a critical edge within the increasingly competitive talent pool market. First, design a program of their own for recruiting and selecting adults with high functioning autism. Next, through a collaboration with various universities including the University of Queensland and Macquarie University, Neurodiversity Hubs were established; an initiative designed to assist neurodivergent students with obtaining work experience and internships. In doing so, they faced the following key challenges: How could they design a recruitment and selection strategy for neurodivergent individuals that was equitable, ethical, and efficient? In particular, where could they find suitable neurodivergent candidates, what criteria should they use to select them, and how should they handle unsuccessful candidates to ensure beneficial outcomes for all stakeholders?

While such research has advanced our understanding of social networks at the inter-personal, inter-unit and inter-organizational level, repeated calls have been made for network research to attend to the situated meanings attached to both relationships and network structures. In this article, we advance a nascent literature on qualitative methods for social network analysis by drawing together developments in visual network research from across the social sciences. We introduce a typology of three visual methods for the collection of network data using network maps: participatory network mapping, network map interviews and visual network surveys. Drawing on three empirical examples from our research in the inter-organizational domain, we demonstrate how these methods can be used for the collection of qualitative and quantitative relational data, and how they can be triangulated with other qualitative methods and social network analysis. We evaluate the merits and limitations of the methods presented and conclude that visual network research is a useful addition to existing methods for network research in business and management studies. © 2019 British Academy of Management",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061190670

Developing the idea of ‘infrastructure as partial connection’ with inspiration from Marilyn Strathern and Science and Technology Studies, this article proposes that database infrastructures are intrinsic to processes of organizing intra- and inter-organizational relations. Seeing infrastructure as partial connection brings our attention to the ontological experimentation with knowing organizations through work of establishing and cutting relations. We illustrate this claim through a multi-sited ethnographic study of ‘The Data Warehouse’. ‘The Data Warehouse’ is an important infrastructural component in the current reorganization of Danish educational governance which makes schools’ performance public and comparable. We suggest that ‘The Data Warehouse’ materializes different, but overlapping, infrastructural experiments with governing education at different organizational sites enacting a governmental hierarchy. Each site can be seen as belonging to the same governance infrastructure but also as constituting ‘centres’ in its own right. ‘The Data Warehouse’ participates in the always-unfinished business of organizational world making and is made to (partially) relate to different organizational concerns and practices. This argument has implications for how we analyze the organizational effects of pervasive databased governance infrastructures and invites exploring their multiple organizing effects. © The Author(s) 2018.","Education; ethnography; information technology; infrastructure; ontology; partial connection; Science and Technology Studies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058715099

For example, the conversion of academic scientific knowledge into technologies that can be owned and sold (i.e., science commercialization) is a growing global trend and key stakeholders have different ethical responses to this contested commodity. Commercialization of science can be viewed as a good thing because people believe it bolsters economic growth and broadly benefits society. Others view it as bad because they believe it discourages basic research that ought to be freely shared without concern for profit. Taking a descriptive sociological approach, we posit that the stance of a religious tradition toward capitalism will help shape individual scientists’ views on science commercialization and test whether the religious tradition of scientists correlates with their attitude toward the commercialization of science. To maximize variance on the religious tradition dimension, we analyze pooled data from a cross-national survey of university biologists and physicists encompassing France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Taiwan, Turkey, UK and the USA. We indeed find religious tradition differences. Hindus and scientists with no religious tradition are more likely to agree that commercialization of science “harms a university’s commitment to knowledge production” than Protestants. We end with a discussion on business ethics and the moral limits of the market as well as implications for entrepreneurs of contested commodities. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Academic capitalism; Contested commodity; Religion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031904372

Findings: Results indicate that stressors can disrupt individual components of relationships. However, the overall relationship outcome of behavioral loyalty remains intact with tensile strength coming from other components of the relationship. Originality/value: This research introduces the concept of tensile strength from the material sciences as relevant to dyadic business relationship strength. The outcomes indicate that looking at multiple components of the business relationship provides greater insight into the tensile strength of business relationships. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Buyer-seller relationships; Dyadic; Strength",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056355713

Classification is the most suitable predictive modeling technique in data mining to predict the loan repayment capability of a customer in a banking industry. There are various methods to improve the accuracy of a classification algorithm. The accuracy of random forest classification algorithm can be improved using Ensemble methods, Optimization techniques and Feature selection. Various feature selection methods are available. In this research work a novel hybrid feature selection algorithm using wrapper model and fisher score is introduced. The main objective of this paper is to prove that new hybrid model produces better accuracy than the traditional random forest algorithm. This paper also compares the result obtained from other classification methods and feature selection methods to prove that proposed algorithm produces better classification accuracy. The experiments were being done using tools such as weka, R, and python programming. This research aims at introducing a new technique which can increase the progress of banking sector. The accuracy level of this new algorithm in finding the potential of the customer is much higher than the data mining classification algorithm and thus it proves to be very helpful for bank officers. ©BEIESP.","Classification; Feature; Fisher score; LCPS; Threshold",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069970072

Many large retail brands try to keep their client base interested by becoming partners in cashback websites. These websites are based on a specific type of affiliate marketing whereby customers access a wide range of merchants and obtain financial rewards based on their activities. Besides using this mix of traditional marketing strategies, cashback websites attract new target customers and increase existing customers’ loyalty through recommendations, using a word-of-mouth marketing strategy built on economic incentives for users who refer others to these sites. The literature shows that this strategy is one of the major areas of success of this business model because customers who join following recommendation are more active and are therefore more profitable and loyal to the brand. Nevertheless, the new users who are referred to these sites vary considerably in terms of the number of transactions they make on the site. This study advances research on the design of recommendation-based digital marketing strategies by providing companies with a predictive model.

The resource-based view suggests that strategic partnerships between firms have the potential to create value when resources are pooled together. Scott Crump faces a decision-making situation wherein he analyses the value-creation potential of the original equipment manufacturer partnership with Hewlett-Packard (HP). In addition, contrasting the cultural environments within both organizations would bring in greater complexity and depth to the reflections, analyses and discussions. Often research experts explore these concepts in isolated streams of research. However, in real-world scenarios, these aspects must be integrated for a more comprehensive decision making to take place. It is also recommended for students to analyze how founder characteristics and resources imprint organizations with certain enduring “imprints” that determine strategic outcomes for the firm in unique ways. Research methodology: For the development of this case, the authors interviewed the top management at Stratasys including Scott Crump, Founder and CEO. The authors also interviewed former and current employees of Stratasys, HP, other experts in the printing industry and existing customers in the 3D printing industry. The company made internal documents available to the authors including financial statements, internal meeting presentations, company forecasts and assessment tools. All interviews were recorded and analyzed to obtain and include multiple perspectives from various stakeholders. The authors also conducted extensive online research on the 3D printing industry and utilized data from news articles, interviews and other relevant press materials. Case overview/synopsis: Scott Crump, Founder of Stratasys, a company that developed and sold 3D printers, had always envisioned a future when it would be commonplace for a 3D printer to be on the desk of every engineer. HP approached him with a proposal that had the potential to make that dream come true. Crump knew that Stratasys did not need to partner with HP for a financial reason, but he loved the idea of the technology becoming a standard method for creating parts universally. The case highlights a true-life account of a firm’s founder considering an important strategic alliance and analyzing the ramifications of taking on or refusing this partnership. Complexity academic level: This case has applications in strategic management and small business management courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels. It also contains critical areas of decision making relevant to an advanced strategic management course that focuses on manufacturing strategy or strategic alliance decision making.

The data provider pays great attention to the usage of their data and wants to control it by policies. The purpose of this paper is to develop usage control architecture options to enable data sovereignty in business ecosystems. Design/methodology/approach: The architecture options are developed following the design science research process. Based on requirements from an automotive use case, the authors develop architecture options. The different architecture options are demonstrated and evaluated based on the case study with practitioners from the automotive industry. Findings: This paper introduces different architecture options for implementing usage control (UC). The proposed architecture options represent solutions for UC in business ecosystems. The comparison of the architecture options shows the respective advantages and disadvantages for data provider and data consumer. Research limitations/implications: In this work, the authors address only one case stemming from the German automotive sector. Practical implications: Technical enforcement of data providers policies instead of relying on trust to support collaborative data exchange between companies. Originality/value: This research is among the first to introduce architecture options that provide a technical concept for the implementation of data sovereignty in business ecosystems using UC. Consequently, it supports the decision process for the technical implementation of data sovereignty. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Architecture; Business ecosystem; Data sovereignty; Design science research; Usage control",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066024802

It helps in tumbling the drudgery and thereby increasing the productivity of the labour. Indian agricultural machinery manufacturing sector is quite challenging which consists of countryside farmers, traditional small units, common craftsmen and small scale companies. They are the unorganised manufacturers, who are lacking proper infrastructure, business model and technology intervention. Hence this research has been conducted to identify and analyse the factors influencing the sustainability of Agri Engineering Manufacturing Companies. In this study quantitative research has been carried out. Agri Engineering Manufacturing Companies (AEMC) of the state of Karnataka has been considered as the study population. A total number of 372 AEMC spread across various districts of Karnataka have been identified to conduct the research. Initially the critical factors influencing the Business Sustainability of AEMC have been identified through Pilot Study. Further the variables influencing the Business Sustainability factors have been identified by reviewing scholarly journal articles and feedback collected from the Entrepreneurs of AEMC. The final Survey Questionnaire has been developed and validated by the Focus Group Discussion consisting of the panel members from academic background and Industry experts. Primary data has been collected through telephonic interview, Google Spread sheet and personal interview from the identified AEMC with the help of final Survey Questionnaire. A total number of 354 valid responses were received out of 372 AEMC, thus achieving 95% of response rate. Data analysis has been carried out by using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 25 (SPSS 25) and Analysis of Moment Structures 25 (AMOS 25). Reliability test has been conducted and the Cronbach’s alpha value 0.817 indicated a good level of internal consistency. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin and Bartlett’s Test has been conducted and the KMO value of 0.781was acceptable. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) has been used to develop a model using the latent constructs such as Business Model, Innovation and Technology. There was significant improvement in the Goodness of Fit Statistics values when compared with the initial model and the new model. The Goodness of Fit Statistics values of the new model are Comparative Fit index (CFI) 0.988, Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) 0.958, Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI) 0.923, Normated Fit Index (NFI) 0.956, Tucker Lewis Index (TLI) 0.980, Root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) 0.031, Parsimony Normed-fit index (PNFI) 0.478 and these indicated a good model fit. The key findings of the research indicate that, there is a need to improve the technological infrastructure and operating mechanism for the business sustainability. Also there is need to improve R &D facilities and supporting policies necessary for innovativeness such as open innovation and motivation for employees who bring innovative ideas. © BEIESP.","Agri engineering manufacturing Companies; AMOS; Business model; Business sustainability; Innovation and technology; SPSS; Structural equation modelling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068532115

At a high level, the sector seeks to develop and improve strategies for exploring this information, which frequently has multiple levels of significant hierarchy, so as to find new insights regarding the learning process of individuals in the context of such settings. Therefore, the EDM has contributed to theories of learning investigated by researchers in educational psychological science and the learning methodology. This sector is closely tied with the learning analytics, which are compared and contrasted. This work is a comparative analysis of various decision tree classification algorithms using Engineering students’ academic performance data. Educational Data Mining is the process which extracts knowledge through interesting patterns recognized from large amount of data from educational field. Learning related datasets with the performance of students obtained from educational institutions and processed before actual data mining or data analytics process. Data mining is one of the information discovering regions which is broadly used in the field of computer science. Furthermore is an inter-disciplinary area which has great impact on various other fields such as data analytics in prediction of risk factors in business organizations, medical forecasting and diagnosis, market basket analysis, statistical analysis and forecasting, predictive analysis in various other fields. Data mining has multiple forms such as text data mining, web data mining, visual data mining, spatial data mining and Educational data mining.

Although research and managerial practice has repeatedly shown the importance of IT departments within firms and has commented on the influence of IT departments on business performance, prior research has still no evidence about the value of a strong decision-making IT influence yet. Design/methodology/approach: To prove the influence of the IT department within the company, this study identifies and operationalizes a formative construct determined by four main specifics of the IT department: IT department size, IT department value assessment, IT experience of the top management and degree of digitization. A questionnaire was used to collect the data of 124 experts from companies that could be assigned mainly to the sectors manufacturing, trade as well as information and communication. The data were analyzed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Further, partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) was used to test the proposed model. Findings: The results show that both investments in the size of the IT department as well as in top managers with IT experience, and a high degree of digitization in a company positively influence the role of the IT department. It also shows that a higher general appreciation of the IT department goes hand in hand with a higher influence of IT in the company. The measures are significant as companies, which do have an influential IT department, actually have higher monetary as well as non-monetary business performances. Practical implications: The study is aimed equally at science and practice, as it provides information on the extent to which more importance should be attached to IT management in the future and what organizational adjustments need to be made. Originality/value: Despite the ongoing discussions on the importance of IT management for business performance, no existing studies have delivered evidence that there is a significant direct link between the decision-making influence of IT and the extent of corporate performance. The present work therefore has two objectives. The theoretical goal is to clarify the impact of the IT department on business performance and to identify the factors that make up an influential IT department. The practical objective of the research is to provide recommendations on how firms could establish or expand the IT department. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business performance; Empirical results; IT business value; IT department’s influence; Strategic IT management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059878592

Design/methodology/approach: This paper combines doctrinal legal research examining the GDPR’s application and scope with case studies examining blockchain solutions from an archival theoretic perspective to answer several questions, including: What risks are blockchain solutions said to impose (or mitigate) for organizations dealing with data that is subject to the GDPR? What are the relationships between the GDPR principles and the principles of archival theory? How can these two sets of principles be aligned within a particular blockchain solution? How can archival principles be applied to blockchain solutions so that they support GDPR compliance? Findings: This work will offer an initial exploration of the strengths and weaknesses of blockchain solutions for GDPR compliant information governance. It will present the disjunctures between GDPR requirements and some current blockchain solution designs and implementations, as well as discussing how solutions may be designed and implemented to support compliance. Immutability of information recorded on a blockchain is a differentiating positive feature of blockchain technology from the perspective of trusted exchanges of value (e.g. cryptocurrencies) but potentially places organizations at risk of non-compliance with GDPR if personally identifiable information cannot be removed. This work will aid understanding of how blockchain solutions should be designed to ensure compliance with GDPR, which could have significant practical implications for organizations looking to leverage the strengths of blockchain technology to meet their needs and strategic goals. Research limitations/implications: Some aspects of the social layer of blockchain solutions, such as law and business procedures, are also well understood. Much less well understood is the data layer, and how it serves as an interface between the social and the technical in a sociotechnical system like blockchain. In addition to a need for more research about the data/records layer of blockchains and compliance, there is a need for more information governance professionals who can provide input on this layer, both to their organizations and other stakeholders. Practical implications: Managing personal data will continue to be one of the most challenging, fraught issues for information governance moving forward; given the fairly broad scope of the GDPR, many organizations, including those outside of the EU, will have to manage personal data in compliance with the GDPR. Blockchain technology could play an important role in ensuring organizations have easily auditable, tamper-resistant, tamper-evident records to meet broader organizational needs and to comply with the GDPR. Social implications: Because the GDPR professes to be technology-neutral, understanding its application to novel technologies such as blockchain provides an important window into the broader context of compliance in evolving information governance spaces. Originality/value: The specific question of how GDPR will apply to blockchain information governance solutions is almost entirely novel. It has significance to the design and implementation of blockchain solutions for recordkeeping. It also provides insight into how well “technology-neutral” laws and regulations actually work when confronted with novel technologies and applications. This research will build upon significant bodies of work in both law and archival science to further understand information governance and compliance as we are shifting into the new GDPR world. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Blockchain; Distributed ledger technology; General data protection regulations; Privacy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061628827

This study considers three of these drivers, namely buyer-supplier trust, commitment and supply chain relationship durability. A numerical approach was implemented in which a survey questionnaire was used to collect data from 429 managers and staff members from food retailing firms in the Gauteng province. The study used a non-probability convenience sampling technique to select respondents. Information were analysed through two software packages, namely the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 24.0) and the Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS version 24.0). The main goal of this research is to see if the data fits the model. A confirmatory factor analysis was applied in examining and testing the relationships between observed constructs and their causal latent constructs while structural equation modelling helped in testing the hypothesised relationships among variables. The results of the investigation made known that buyer and supplier trust, commitment and supply chain relationship endurance absolutely and meaningfully impact supply chain performance. This investigation concludes that to achieve greater supply chain performance, food retailers should expedite the levels of trust, commitment and length of relationships with their providers. The outcomes of this study offer valuable understandings on how companies in the food retail industry could profit from trust, commitment and relationship longevity along with on how to develop supply chain performance. The results of this study add to the current body of knowledge by generating new information on buyer-supplier relationships. Therefore, the study is useful to buyers and suppliers in the food retail industry who wish to enhance supply chain performance and develop better relationships. © by author(s); CC-BY.","Buyer-Supplier Commitment; Buyer-Supplier Trust; Commitment-Trust Theory; Supply Chain Performance; Supply Chain Relationship Longevity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091313615

Since big data consumes more storage space that cannot be accommodated with traditional storage devices, cloud computing resources of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is used. Therefore, big data and big data analytics cannot exist without cloud computing. Another important fact is that big data can be subjected to analytics for obtaining Business Intelligence (BI). This process needs distributed programming frameworks like Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Apache Storm and Apache Samza. Without thorough understanding about these frameworks that run in cloud platforms, it is difficult to use them appropriately.

The performance analysis uses a series of bibliometric indicators, such as the h-index, productivity and citations. In addition, the VOSviewer software is used to map the bibliographic material. Science mapping uses co-citations and the concurrency of keywords. References were obtained from the Web of Science database. We identified and classified the most relevant research in the field according to journals, articles, authors, institutions and countries. The results show that research in this field has increased significantly in the last ten years and that the USA is the most influential country in all aspects in this field. It is important to consider, however, that science continues to advance in this and in all fields and that data rapidly change over time.

The proposed model uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) to determine the indexes due to cost leadership and differentiation. The model can be useful to identify the true cost leaders and those who are stuck in the middle. This work suggests the way how the strategic position can be explored from the consumption of resources (unlike the prevalent models like Banker et al., 2014). Design/methodology/approach: Depending on the previous surveys, two inputs (spending per student and percentage of non-poor income group) and two outputs (average scores attained by students in science group and in language group in six private schools, located within the outskirt of Durgapur) were analyzed. Findings: The classification made on the basis of the result of the proposed model reveals that out of the six schools (A, B, C, D, E and F), A, E and F occupy a strong position in this context, whereas B can be an example of stuck in the middle scenario. It not only has to reduce cost by 30 percent but also improve the differentiation index by 140 percent. C and D are lagging behind as they do not have enough differentiating qualities. Research limitations/implications: Only six schools were taken for the analysis. Second, the input and output vectors had to be non-negative. In case of a negative input (output) set, separate treatment must be applied to them before the application of non-central PCA. Any decision-making unit producing an output of 0 will prohibit the use of the non-central PCA. Practical implications: The extant study provides the indices to measure cost leadership and differentiation strategies for the classification as per the generic strategies. A firm which is lagging behind can adjust its consumption to remain successful. Social implications: According to Hillman and Jenkner (2002), the developing countries lack the willingness of a primary school to impart education to children. The current study is used to explore whether any private primary school has the same goal or not. They also pointed out the possible future consequences while stating that the cost of educating children from the poorer section might be outweighed by the cost of not educating them and adults lacking basic skills had greater difficulty in finding well-paying jobs to escape poverty. So it is important to understand the role of a private primary school to offer seats to underprivileged students for educating them. The intention of six private primary schools toward educating the population of the small area within Durgapur is analyzed in this study, The study revealed that few schools spend more to serve the students belonging to upper classes to remain successful, whereas few schools as a differentiator make conscious attempts for providing services to poorer sections in an economical manner like a cost leader. Originality/value: The extant research aims to formulate the determining methods of identifying strategic groups (proposed by Hunt, 1983) to make a parity between business definition view and strategic type concepts.

Design/methodology/approach: This study is cross-sectional and correlational. Data were collected through a questionnaire survey of 214 owner-managed SBEs in Uganda through their managers. Data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Findings: Attitude towards electronic tax system, adoption of electronic tax system and isomorphic forces significantly contribute to tax compliance to the extent of 57.4 per cent. Isomorphic forces have a high predictive power of tax compliance as compared with attitude towards electronic tax system. Further, coercive, normative and mimetic isomorphism as constructs of isomorphic forces are significantly associated with tax compliance. Research limitations/implications: Given that this study was cross-sectional, monitoring changes in behaviour over time was not possible. The results are useful for policy makers and taxpayers in developing countries. These results can also be generalized to other developing countries especially those in Africa and other continents dominated by developing countries. Originality/value: To the researchers’ knowledge, this is the first study to examine the contribution of attitude towards electronic tax system, adoption of electronic tax system and isomorphic forces to tax compliance of SBEs in a developing country in a single study on the African scene. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adoption of electronic tax system; Attitude towards electronic tax system; Institutional theory; Isomorphic forces; Tax compliance; Technology acceptance model; Theory of reasoned action",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063295023

In 2011, the Russian Government set ambitious goals in science, technology and innovation, and uses its large SOEs as channels to achieve these targets. These initiatives focus on the collaboration among innovation actors and introduce open innovation (OI) principles. Based on a large-scale innovation survey, we compare private enterprises to state-owned peers and present selected case studies. Our data support the claim that Russian SOEs are driving the demand for technology and mainly absorb incoming OI activities. Different to their peers, SOEs extend their OI activities to the country’s knowledge producers, such as research and technology organisations (RTOs), and leading universities. They work on incorporating scientific knowledge that could, indeed, hold the key to globally competitive technological innovations, but also have better capabilities to include business partners.

Grounding our argumentation on group decision-making literature, we argue that adverse behavior patterns may affect the way in which consensus is achieved within the team, and that team performance has an inverted U-shaped relationship with the level of consensus. Then, by relying on leadership literature, we pose the hypothesis that the level of shared leadership inside the group moderates this U-shaped relationship. To empirically test our literature-based argumentation, we use longitudinal data collected in the years 2014 and 2015 from business process reengineering projects, each lasting three months, conducted by 141 master of science students grouped in 34 teams. We conclude by emphasizing that it is important to control for the occurrence of behaviors which lead to “fake” consensus within operational teams, by observing the individuals’ satisfaction with respect to the group decision as well as their active participation in the decision-making process. © 2018 Decision Sciences Institute","Abilene Paradox; and Performance; Business Process Reengineering; Group Decision-Making; Groupthink; Operational Team; Shared Leadership",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050793486

Also, it has played a significant role in business ecosystem, and the achievement of science and technology have greatly spread to the development of both local and global firms. However, there are factors that discourage the applicable capabilities of such innovations on business processes. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the degrees of barriers which block the use of innovation in the case of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam namely human resources, access to finance, transparency, tax rates, trade regulations and customs. The secondary data used were gathered from Enterprise survey (ES) of 479 small and medium enterprises in five different regions (Red River Delta, North Central Coast, Central Coast Area, South East and Mekong River Delta), which are conducted by the World Bank Group from 2015 to 2017. The binary logistic regression and Logit Model were used to process variables and data analysis. The major findings revealed that barriers of accessing financial capacity, trading regulations and customs have positively affected on innovation of SMEs in Vietnam.

As a genuine branch of Marketing science, digital marketing managed to create value to the organizations and increased the engagement with the customers through electronic services. Digital era has helped industries monitor their procedures including branding, promotion, advertising, production, channel distribution etc. Based on gathered data, interactive customer experience and a digital overview of procedures and sales, business managers could make more accurate and data driven decisions. Due to the excessive amount of data which is daily generated customers journey and experience turn to become extremely complicated. Organizations invest high budgets to cover the lack of information or the potential customers which have never been mapped. The large volume of data generated lead to a chaotic environment which marketer must handle. Users data daily change and decision makers must deal with this reality. The need of use smart applications within organizations emerges to better analyze, classify, optimize and target audiences. Technology aware customers lead industries to bigger financial investments and sophisticated solutions. Based on a high complex data world, marketers must identify their needs and search for advanced technological solutions. Business world manage to implement smart apps which directly affect marketing world and decision makers. Intelligent data-based driven models could lead to customer action predictions based on dependent variables of interest.

Solving the Information and Communication Technology (IT) support of these processes belongs to the preferred topics of current research. The business and industrial Information and Knowledge Management Systems are well-managed at a level of simple data processing. But there is a gap in the software support for the higher top manager level, as well as regarding the personalized IT support for knowledge workers in the knowledge-based organizations. In fact, it is crucial for the knowledge workers to solve the conversion of tacit knowledge to explicit knowledge and to transfer and exchange knowledge both individually and collaboratively. Currently, the IT support is moving to the cloud and virtual environments, so complex software, hardware, and network infrastructures are needed. This requires a design and technology team behind every knowledge worker. The actual research of the authors is focused on automating the knowledge-based processes. A basic question is to define the knowledge as a process parameter. To challenge the above-mentioned gaps, a virtual Knowledge Unit (vKWU) has been designed that is both human- and machine-readable. This knowledge representation enables to design the WPad software, solve the batch knowledge processing paradigm for knowledge creation and sharing, and IT support of the Knowledge Management processes of knowledge workers. The WPad works in practice as a multi-purpose IT tool for conversion of tacit information to explicit information, including the personalized Knowledge Management System, as was presented by the authors in the previous ICICKM conferences. While under research on the technology-enhanced learning, their focus was on Knowledge Management (KM) in education (teaching, self-study, CSCL). Now, the research focus is on testing the online virtual spaces for KM. Currently, Cloud Content and Project Management are tested on the BOX-cloud, including the KM at the faculty’s virtual space, where the content and processes are modelled by the V4+ACARD Consortium. The paper explains by examples the research paradigm in the context of KM, and the use of the KM software for text corpora, cloud content management and research. © 2019 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

There are numerous scientific publications regarding artificial intelligence (AI) across the disciplines. However, referring to digital marketing aspects, this number remains small. Scientific research on artificial intelligence (AI) could benefit marketing science in numerous ways. Nowadays, only a small amount of scientific research referring to digital marketing and artificial intelligence (AI) is related to specific digital marketing methods. Most of the scientific research examines generic aspects such as e-business, consumer behavior, e-commerce strategies, social media advertisement, search engines and consumer predictive modeling avoid being more related to specific marketing issues in which business world is more aware of, like consumer behavior on social media, targeted advertisements, social media marketing, conversion optimization, predictive models in online purchases, chatbots etc. Despite the vast research area and a certain number of publications, it seems that there is a lack of scientific publications regarding specifically digital marketing and artificial intelligence (AI). Never the less, there are some very extensive research attempts on specific digital marketing matters and artificial intelligence (AI) that are promising. This paper through the mapping of the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) applications on digital marketing scientific area, highlights the corner stone publications, comes up with areas of absence or lack of its presence, mentioning at the same possible reasons why that occurs and provides a machine learning model that could fit in several digital marketing occasions. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence (AI); Big data; Customer behavior; Decision making; Digital marketing; Predictive modeling",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096964564

As a nation develops, governmental expenditure on R&D decreases, and businesses take on an increasing role to fill the gap, increasing local innovation. Our portfolio of local versus foreign resident ownership of patents highlights implications for taxation/innovation policies. Countries with high foreign ownership of patents have low tax revenues due to the lack of associated costs with, and mobility of income from, patents. We call on these countries to devise targeted policies encouraging local patent ownership. Policy makers should also recognize factors influencing high-technology exports for innovation. Lastly, we call on countries to reinstate horizontal and vertical policies, and design national innovation ecosystems that integrate disparate policies in an effort to drive economic growth through innovation. © The Author(s). 2019.","Exports; Innovation; Panel analysis; Patents; Research and development; Science and technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093698401

Economic crises, business insolvencies, and economic scandals in recent years have increased the importance of financial reporting. For this reason, the responsibility of those preparing the financial reports, the presenters, and the auditors has increased. Because of the nature of the profession, a number of issues have become important, especially in terms of the preparation of financial data for the enterprises, keeping the records of books, giving place to equity and impartiality, protection of confidentiality, focusing on the auditing standards and principles, and giving place to independence in the audit (Akbas et al., 2009). The structures and management approaches of the enterprises are changing with globalization. Therefore, the accounting profession also changes and increases the quality of the information produced. But the irregular increase in the number of professionals and unfair competition (Ömürbek and Türkoglu, 2013) caused an increase in unethical behaviors in the accounting profession. In order to eliminate unethical behaviors, it is necessary to develop professional ethics in the accounting profession. For this purpose, professional ethics principles and rules of accounting profession have been revised, and new laws have been enacted by professional organizations in the world and in our country.

The digital society is marked by different discourses on the role of big data and analytics in the domains of business, health and education. In education, these discourses place the higher education sector at a crossroads between transformational challenges and opportunities. At the same time, the sector is already witnessing sweeping large-scale technological and pedagogical disruption, requiring a far-reaching drastic transformation of teaching, learning and research. The technological disruptions are brought about by the increasing permeation of distributed mobile, ubiquitous and enterprise technologies into the learning and teaching environments. Also, there is a widespread global demand for neoliberal educational policy reforms, particularly on the issues of global quality in the provision of education, standards, compliance and accountability, student mobility and massification of educational offerings. To adequately respond to the various transformations needed in the sector, institutions are required to engage in the utilization of data to help them address the complex challenges they face. However, harvesting and analysing this data remains an artificial reality, since it requires extensive investment in data science expertise and growing the data-informed decision-making. Researchers have questioned the ability of educational researchers to fully utilize big data and analytics to address the critical educational problems of our time. This chapter examines current research on big data and analytics in higher education and discusses critical issues likely to affect the practice of big data for educational research. It outlines opportunities afforded by analytics and big data in the context of education, and outlines challenges educational researchers need to deal with to maximize the opportunities afforded by big data and analytics, as they transition from educational research into research education that utilizes data science approaches. © John Storm Pedersen and Adrian Wilkinson 2019.

It serves as a basic text for those who wish to learn and apply econometric analysis in empirical research. The level of presentation is as simple as possible to make it useful for undergraduates as well as graduate students. It contains several examples with real data and Stata programmes and interpretation of the results. While discussing the statistical tools needed to understand empirical economic research, the book attempts to provide a balance between theory and applied research. Various concepts and techniques of econometric analysis are supported by carefully developed examples with the use of statistical software package, Stata 15.1, and assumes that the reader is somewhat familiar with the Strata software. The topics covered in this book are divided into four parts. Part I discusses introductory econometric methods for data analysis that economists and other social scientists use to estimate the economic and social relationships, and to test hypotheses about them, using real-world data. There are five chapters in this part covering the data management issues, details of linear regression models, the related problems due to violation of the classical assumptions. Part II discusses some advanced topics used frequently in empirical research with cross section data. In its three chapters, this part includes some specific problems of regression analysis. Part III deals with time series econometric analysis. It covers intensively both the univariate and multivariate time series econometric models and their applications with software programming in six chapters. Part IV takes care of panel data analysis in four chapters. Different aspects of fixed effects and random effects are discussed here. Panel data analysis has been extended by taking dynamic panel data models which are most suitable for macroeconomic research. The book is invaluable for students and researchers of social sciences, business, management, operations research, engineering, and applied mathematics. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Applied econometrics; Cross-sectional models; Econometrics; Models with panel data; Time-series models",,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085792054

At the front-end of innovation, firms are challenged to evaluate growing amounts of information within shorter time frames in order to stay competitive. Either they spend significant time on structured data analysis, at the risk of delayed market launch, or they follow their intuition, at the risk of not meeting market trends. Both scenarios constitute a significant risk for a firm's continued existence. Motivated by this, a conceptual model is presented in this paper that aims at remediating these risks. Grounded on design science methodology, it concentrates on previous assessments of innovation search fields. These innovation search fields assist in environmental scanning and lay the foundation for deciding which opportunities to pursue. The model applies a novel AI-based approach, which draws on natural language processing and information retrieval. To provide decision support, the approach includes market-, technology-, and firm-related criteria. This allows us to replace intuitive decision-making by fact-based considerations. In addition, an often-iterative approach for environmental scanning is replaced by a more straightforward process. Early testing of the conceptual model has shown results of increased quality and speed of decision-making. Further testing and feedback is still required to enhance and calibrate the AI-functionality. Applied in business environments, the approach can contribute to remediate fuzziness in early front-end activities, thus helping direct innovation managers to “do the right things”. © 2012 Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Mexico.

Unfortunately, despite large resources spent on R&D, multifactor productivity of pharmaceuticals is on the decline for several years now. Because of this business reality, pharmaceutical companies have seen a notable change in the traditional operating model and footprint over the past couple of decades. Outsourcing, in particular, has emerged as a successful business model for many pharmaceutical companies looking for ways to strategically increase their R&D capabilities and to augment their in-house resources. How to Integrate Quality by Efficient Design (QbED) in Product Development bridges the gap between theory and practice when it comes to strategic decision-making in a pharmaceutical research scenario. This book will introduce the concept of QbED and focus on various aspects such as patient-centric product designs, platform-based manufacturing technologies, business acuity, and regulatory strategies to balance the challenges in outsourcing with the need for strategic and statistically sound experiments rooted in good science. Detailed discussions will cover pharmaceutical business models, regulatory approval process, quality by design (QbD), business analytics, and manufacturing excellence specifically for small molecules and solid oral dosage forms.

A questionnaire was used for collecting the data from a sample of 499 senior bachelor's degree students, studying business in the Faculty of Management Science at Ubon Ratchathani University. The reliability of the questionnaire was found to be 0.94. Descriptive statistics and the CFA second order model from MPLUS were used in this study. The results showed that the observed set of data for the student satisfaction of service quality in FMS fit the factor theory model. The most significant factor was the service quality of instruction. All correlations among the six main factors for the student satisfaction of service quality were statistically significant. The items of the 6 factors had validity values ranging from high to very high. The highest factor loading to the smallest factor loading values for the student satisfaction of service quality were found to be for instruction, measurement and assessment, qualitative aspects of the lecturers, preparation for professional practice, program content, and supervision respectively; thus the service quality of supervision in FMS must be improved before other components. In the students' view, the advisor must carry out more ""follow up"" actions for students, and find the best method to solve students' problems. The outcomes of the study lead to implications for improving the service quality in the Faculty of Management Science, strategic planning for professional practice, and for future research. © 2019 Assumption University.","Business management; Factor analysis; Service quality; Student satisfaction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080903381

Presented and discussed include the state of system models in relation to five modelling views of the ARD systems, namely: (i) defining factors for agricultural echo systems, (ii) farm characterization and management practices, (iii) simulation systems for predictable farm data, (iv) limiting factors for agricultural optimization, and (v) performance estimation through benchmarking. Also, the paper proposes a new framework to support FAABB in Tanzania that is being tested through various use-cases in the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT) with a FAABB Cyber Studio hosted at the Nelson Mandela - African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST) also in Tanzania. The FAABB setup at NM-AIST promises to address not only the agricultural knowledge codification problem, but also the need for cultural change among agricultural researchers to ensure that data for addressing a range of use-cases is available for future mobile application development. The proposed FAABB framework provides a useful starting point for addressing limitations of existing frameworks and considering a ubiquitous m-app development framework for targeted ARD research in developing countries. © 2019 University of Bahrain.

Information processing using knowledge-, service-, and cloud-based systems makes the use of complex, dynamic and often knowledge-intensive activities an inevitable task. Knowledge-intensive processes contain a set of coordinated tasks and activities, controlled by knowledge workers to achieve a business objective or goal. Recruitment process - i.e., the process of attracting, shortlisting, selecting and appointing suitable candidates for jobs within an organization - is an example of a knowledge-intensive process, where recruiters (i.e., knowledge workers who have the experience, understanding, information, and skills) control various tasks from advertising positions to analyzing the candidates’ Curriculum Vitae.

We present a framework and algorithms (namely iRecruit) to: (i) imitate the knowledge of recruiters into the domain knowledge; and (ii) extract data and knowledge from business artifacts (e.g., candidates’ CV and job advertisements) and link them to the facts in the domain Knowledge Base. We adopt a motivating scenario of recruitment challenges to find the right fit for Data Scientists role in an organization. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Data-driven business processes; Knowledge-intensive business processes; Process data analytics; Process data science","Data Analytics; Knowledge based systems; Business objectives; Business Process; Domain knowledge base; Framework and algorithms; Knowledge intensive process; Knowledge-intensive business; Process data; Recruitment process; Knowledge management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075553288

We open with a discussion about the origin of Data Science and its requirement for a challenging mix of capability in data analytics, information technology, and business know-how. The mission of Data Science is to provide new or revised computational theory able to extract useful information from the massive volumes of data collected at an accelerating pace. In fact, besides the traditional measurements, digital data obtained from images, text, audio, sensors, etc complement the survey. Then, we review the different and most popular methodologies among the practitioners of Data Science research and applications. In addition, because the emerging field requires personnel with new competences, we attempt to describe the Data Scientist profile, one of the sexiest jobs of the 21st Century according to Davenport and Patil. Most people are aware of the need to embrace Data Science, but they feel intimidated that they do not understand it and they worry that their jobs will disappear. We want to encourage them: Data Science is more likely to add value to jobs and enrich the lives of working people by helping them make better, more informed business decisions. We conclude this paper by presenting examples of Data Science in action in business and industry, to demonstrate the collection of specialist skills that must come together for this new science to be effective. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","business improvement; Data Scientist profile; Industry 4.0; knowledge discovery; SME","Computation theory; Data Analytics; Data mining; Industry 4.0; Technology transfer; Business decisions; Business improvements; Computational theories; Data Scientist profile; Digital datas; Emerging topics; Science research; Working people; Data Science",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074688242

This study was based on an extensive review of literature from a range of peer reviewed papers on social media and tourist destination planning. A number of sources were accessed such as Science Direct, Google Scholar, Emerald Insights Journals, Institutional Repository, Scopus, JSTOR, Taylor & Francis, SAePublications, Sabinet, and ProQuest, while articles from tourism organisations such as the World Tourism Organisation were also consulted. The sources were thus used as part of data collection procedure and were critically examined for information related to social media and travel decision-making processes. The objectives of the study were achieved through literature findings which demonstrated that social media sites are used at each stage of trip planning but are predominantly used at the information search stage and after trip for experience sharing. The review of literature also shows that social media sites are now being considered as the most reliable sources of information following recommendations from family and friends. It is critical for tourism business owners to be present in social media sites to connect with prospective customers. They also need to understand the types of social media sites frequently used by tourists in different regions and to ensure that content regarding their attractions and services is always accurately posted on those sites. © 2019 AJHTL /Author/s.","Decision-making process; Destination; Social media; Trip planning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074441812

The study then analyses a sample of 191,276 analytics positions advertised on LinkedIn. The authors describe the demand for various types of analytics professionals and compare four of the most highly sought-after roles, namely, data scientist, marketing analytics, business analytics and data science professionals. Content analysis of position descriptions and job requirements is used to determine any similarities in competencies within each of the three categories of skill set (ie hard skills, soft skills and credentials) specified by employers seeking analytics professionals. Among the similarities is the growing acknowledgment that data analytics applied to large and complex datasets requires a new breed of employee - an employee who is fully grounded in a business domain, but who also has a breadth of analytical and personal skills. The paper then assesses the challenges that organisations face when recruiting employees with the desired skills.

A panel data approach was used to investigate factors influencing the growth of on-cluster firms using off-cluster firms as a control group. Size and age influence turnover, as does the ability to innovate, but whereas size and age have a quadratic (nonlinear) impact on financial growth, innovation capabilities have a positive linear impact. Employment is mainly correlated to age, previous years' innovation and shareholder investment.

To this end, government of these nations seek to promote entrepreneurship as a means of economic revitalization and sustainability mostly in rural areas. However, the success of entrepreneurship in any country may depend on several factors that could be explained theoretically. In social and behvioural sciences, theories have been constantly employed to provide explanations to social life issues bothering mankind. This article employed such theories to explain Igbo business mentoring (nwa boy) which most entrepreneurs in South-East GeoPolitical Zone of Nigeria seem to have engaged in establishing their businesses. These include: (i) Sociological Theory of Entrepreneurship; (ii) Anthropological Entrepreneurship Theory; (iii) Opportunity-Based Entrepreneurship Theory (iii) Resource-Based Entrepreneurship Theories; and (iv)The Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition, among others. Historical data was used to examine these theories in connection with the Igbo business mentoring (nwa boy) in order to enrich the body of knowledge on the social life reality of its contributions to entrepreneurial development in Nigeria. The importance of this effort is hinged on the fact that none of these theories has hitherto been applied to the Igbo business mentoring (nwa boy) in business and academic literature. The study concludes that the understanding the 'nwa boy' mentoring concept in the light of these theories could provide leverage for a successful entrepreneurial activities, mostly among youth. © 2019 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).","Business; Entrepreneurial; Exploring; Igbo; Mentoring (Nwa boy); Theories",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074069351

As before, human potential is the strong point of Russian innovation system but the risk of decline in its quality and of â€œbrain drainâ€ is high. In terms of share of population with higher education and quality of school education Russia is at the same level as the leading world countries. Quality of university education is getting better; Russian higher educational institutions are strengthening their positions in certain subject ratings. At the same time, negative short-term dynamics in the development of high-tech and science-based types of activity (amid internal growth) and negative long-term dynamics in the development of information industry have been observed.

This crucial element is people: talented professionals who can use existing digital technologies and quickly adapt, using new methods and approaches. Without these people, it would be difficult for companies to fully realize the potential of the latest technological developments: Industry 4.0, robots, artificial intelligence, advanced data analysis methods, virtual reality and new digital business models. The digital transformation of a company can be successful only if there are people in the company who can competently carry it out. It is those people who can make technology work for the benefit of the company and create new business opportunities with the help of new ideas. These professionals will be the most sought-after and scarce in the job market. It is necessary not only to acquire new, outside talent to specific positions, but also to develop the digital skills of employees that are already working within the company. The most important thing to understand is how digital professionals think. The article analyzes the human resource component of business digitalization and explains the key questions that are connected to it: who is needed, how to attract competent personnel, how to raise the digital knowledge level of all employees. © 2019 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).","CDO; Digital competencies; Digital profiles; Digital skills; Digital transformation; Digitalization; Human potential; Technological breakthrough",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074069169

The articles are discussed through the prism of design science research that originates in engineering and computer science. In contrast with natural and social sciences that aim to develop and test theories about the world, the objective of design science is to create new artifacts that are useful for solving important practical problems. In audit research, design science methodology was originally used implicitly in early studies devoted to developing and evaluating audit analytical procedures and audit sampling techniques. The recent advances in information technology necessitate renewed attention to this research methodology especially given the profound changes in accounting, auditing, and business processes currently underway. © 2019, American Accounting Association.

The hypothesis of the discrete role of these cities in the development and formation of the country innovation system is also checked in the study. With this purpose, the holistic analysis of the innovation activity of the science cities is made, and the comparison with the national data is drawn. To accomplish this, we use various characteristics of innovation process which show both its inputs and outputs. The level of companies' involvement in innovation process is also investigated as well as the innovation costs structure. The costs of in-house R&D, production design, personnel training and the costs of marketing research are analyzed among the others in the paper. The cost structure of technological innovation depending on the financial source is also considered. In particular, we study the ratio of firms own costs on technological innovation to budgetary financing. Their industry affiliation is considered as a crucial factor which determines firm's innovation activity. For this particular reason, we analyze the company's innovation process within different industries. The approach offered in the paper allows to estimate the effectiveness of innovation activity of science cities firms in comparison with other national companies and reveal the industries based in the science cities with the much bigger innovation results than others. The further paired analysis of the revealed industries for the studied economic areas and the country in the whole makes it rather possible to establish the factors which slow down the development of the individual branch and identify the opportunities for the breakthrough in innovation process quality. © Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE 2019.

Companies often find themselves operating in uncertain, fast-moving and unpredictable environments, where experimental and discovery-driven approaches may result beneficial for both established companies and startups. Experimentation and hypotheses falsification can play a key role in validating and legitimizing business model choices and shifts by aiding executives and entrepreneurs in selecting the most suitable strategic alternatives to pursue and reducing uncertainty related to decision-making. The learning school of strategy and the adaptive approach have extended and built on the argument supporting the adoption of an approach based on learning, testing and the use of empirical data to reduce uncertainty in decision-making. An increasing number of scholars have since been igniting the discourse on the role of scientific methods in entrepreneurship and strategy-making although often lacking comprehensiveness in analyzing and including approaches and methods that are actually employed in entrepreneurial and corporate practices. This study aims at addressing the similarities and differences between different experimental approaches undertaken by startups and established companies in dealing with uncertainty, often connected to renewal processes or the launch of new products and services. By means of a critical discussion, we provide conceptual considerations about the different experimental approaches and their relationship with the scientific method. © Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE 2019.

The innovative idea of decentralized Web (DWeb) is based on communication without the centralized operators. Instead users keep control of their data and connect or interact directly with others in their network avoiding risks such as hacking, surveillance, control and censorship. The DWeb is under early stage of development for now, but the number of the experimental apps and programs built on the decentralized models is increasing. Some of the more developed products include OpenBazaar (a decentralized marketplace), Graphite Docs (a Google documents alternative), Textile Photos (an Instagram-like alternative for storing, managing, and sharing photos on the DWeb), Matrix (which provides Slack and WhatsApp alternatives) and DTube (a YouTube alternative), etc. The Blockchain technology has increasingly been adapted to enable innovative “decentralized” business models for the sharing economy and thereby potentially provide an alternative to traditional “centralized” economy business models. The joint research, implemented by bitfwd community (http://bitfwd.com/) and University of New South Wales Sydney (Australia), Vilnius Gediminas Technical University and Social Technologies LAB (Lithuania) aimed to deepen understanding about sustainable business models for decentralized Web.

This has hindered a deeper comprehension of the economic mechanisms that shape evolutionary trends in entrepreneurial activity and how they operate in distinct places. We propose that EE have regularities, but they can also assume different configurations, i.e., varying combinations of influential dimensions. Through fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, we address this issue with data from the State of São Paulo, Brazil. This research focuses on five EE dimensions: Science & Technology, Human Capital, Market Dynamics, Business Dynamics, and Infrastructure. Findings point at the heterogeneous nature of EE distributed in three different paths. While configurations' vary in terms of causal conditions, research universities, knowledge-intensive jobs and wider credit operations are core-causal conditions.

Given the early developments of hardware to perform the required calculations, the initial focus was on providing software to interface to the requirements of the user. As the power of the hardware increased, larger amounts of output were produced. At the same time, the transition to increasing use of the Internet and mobile computing has generated a much wider variety of data types. This complexity of data has generated an increasing requirement for specialized software tools and environments to provide the processing and analysis required. The objective is to understand the meaning of complex datasets. Business and commerce wish to know how their products and services meet the current and future requirements of the market place, as well as understanding the meaning of data that is internal to their own organizations. The rise of data science is due principally to the need to analyze large and complex datasets with high-value content.

In a first phase, 2017 IS program data was obtained from university websites. In a second phase, this data was validated in consultation with academic staff from those universities offering the programs. The conclusion is that a high level of adherence to the IS2010 curricula was evident in core courses; considerable diversity was found in a long tail of non-core offerings; and the location of the host academic unit within Business or Science/Engineering/Technology influenced the subject areas offered. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Academic administrative units; ACM/AIS 2010 model curriculum; Bodies of knowledge; Computing education; Core curriculum",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070578826

Authors stated two research questions - which areas of AI are used in marketing and what implications AI delivers for marketing managers. To answer those questions, the authors conducted research on secondary data with AI examples used for marketing purpose. The analysis of gathered examples shows that AI is widely introduced into the marketing field, though the applications are at the operational level. This may be the effect of careful implementation of the new technology, still at the level of experimenting with it. The uncertainty of the outcome of AI implementation may affect the caution in putting these innovations into practice as well. Gathered examples proved that AI influences all aspects of marketing mix impacting both consumer value delivery as well as the marketing organization and management.

Articles concerning the role of PA and BI in CI projects were utilised in a systematic literature review. Furthermore, the paper stresses the vital role that big data analytics plays in both CI and PA during decision-making. The paper studies other important CI and PA aspects that pertain to continuous improvement projects, which are aspects that are often overlooked in the existing literature. The findings from this study emphasise the critical role that PA tools and concepts can and should have in CI initiatives. Critical organisational and operational structures also need to be implemented to establish and maintain the use of PA tools and concepts in CI initiatives.

The tourism industry is also undoubtedly one of the largest sectors earning foreign exchange. Given the many benefits of religious tourism as one type of tourism, many countries have begun assigning greater importance to marketing of religious sites. Creating greater awareness of religious tourism in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan can have a far-reaching impact. State agencies and tourist organizations have the responsibility of informing, persuading and identifying potential tourists. Consequently, marketers need to use the various components of promotion efficiently so that they can get ahead in increasing the number of expected users. Promotion will support in efforts to maximize the duration of stay, and the frequency of visits through offering new tourist products in Jordan, to areas such as Madaba, which is clearly unexploited or only often partially exploited, to boost tourism from pilgrims. This study aimed at identifying the role of tourism promotion mix in activating Christian religious tourism in the Jordanian Governorate of Madaba. Secondary data sources such as books, studies and statistics of the Jordanian Ministry of Tourism, relying mainly on the questionnaire were used as sources of preliminary data Three hundred questionnaires were distributed to a group of local and foreign tourists in Madaba Governorate and were subjected to statistical analysis (250) using the statistical packages for social sciences. The study proved to be an important one showing the role for all factors of the tourist promotion mix (advertisement, sales activation, publicity, personal selling) in activating Christian religious tourism. The publicity aspect turned out to be the most influential factors followed by the tourist activation sales, advertisement and personal selling respectively. © 2019 AJHTL.","Activation tourism; Christian tourism; Religious tourism; Tourism promotion; Tourist promotion mix",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068009854

SMTEs have the potential to benefit local communities through creating jobs, especially in small towns such as Hogsback in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. The purpose of this research was to investigate the ability of SMTEs to promote local economic development (LED) in Hogsback. . This approach used in this study was based on a mixed methodology and a systematic random sample of SMTEs in the Hogsback area was drawn. A questionnaire was used to collect primary data from 70 respondents. Secondary data were collected through a review of relevant literature found in books, articles, journals, state publications and the internet. The key data were captured and analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. The findings showed that 93.34% of respondents agreed that SMTEs create economic benefit and 90% agreed that the economy of Hogsback relies heavily on the tourism sector. Most importantly, all of the respondents (100%) agreed that the tourism industry is the biggest employer in Hogsback. The study recognised that SMTEs in Hogsback provide significant economic benefits and contribute towards LED. However, they lack information on how they can get support from government institutions in order to grow and develop and this remains a problem. A number of SMTEs are not contributing to LED for this reason. Government agencies should assist SMTEs with finance, market access and other needs to ensure their success in creating economic diversification from agricultural dominated Hogsback and achieve business survival and sustainability. © 2019 AJHTL.","Hogsback; Local economic development; SMTEs; South Africa; Tourism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067828858

Today, all the fields, including science, business, industry, and sports, are influenced by the profound and sustained changes. New rules arise every day; organizations, especially sports clubs, are in an endless struggle to gain competitive advantage in the battle for survival and power stealth. The main function of competitive advantage is to guarantee the survival of organizations, so that they can succeed in their path to developments. Objectives. This study is a field research aimed to model the competitive advantage of Iranian Soccer Clubs based on the team reputation considering the satisfaction level of fans. Methods. The statistical population of the study included the fans of the teams of Iranian Premier League (2017-2018), among which 384 fans were selected as the sample. The measurement tool included the questionnaires of the public relations, brand image and identity, satisfaction, team reputation, and competitive advantage. Validity and reliability of the questionnaires were confirmed by experts using the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) and Cronbach's alpha test. The descriptive statistical tests including the central tendency, dispersion, and inferential statistics (the structural equation test) were used for data analysis. SPSS software version 19 was used for the descriptive analysis and LISREL software for the analysis of the structural equation modeling. Results. The variables of public relations, brand identity, and brand image have a positive and significant effect on the team reputation. Also, satisfaction level of fans has a positive and significant effect on the competitive advantage of soccer clubs. Conclusion. The findings confirmed the significance of the conceptual model of the research. However, more studies should be conducted to identify other dimensions influencing the competitive advantage of teams. © 2019 Asian Exercise and Sport Science Association.","Competitive advantage; Fan; Football team; Team reputation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067033185

This paper focusses on processes that can be characterized as loosely framed and knowledge-intensive (e.g. diagnosis and treatment of a patient in a hospital). Declarative process modeling languages that incorporate decision logic are well suited to model these processes and tools for the automatic discovery of such models from the data in the current IT-systems are starting to appear. However, the resulting models are often difficult for humans to understand, which makes it hard to implement them. Process engines can help to overcome this problem, as they can handle the complexity of the model and support the users to correctly execute it. Process engines are common ground for imperative models, but the offerings on the declarative side are more limited. This paper uses the design science methodology to develop a generic framework for flexible and data-aware process engines. The declarative model supports the direct flexibility needs of the process actor during execution, and it also enables a more general flexibility of the information system as changes to the model can be enacted immediately. An implementation of proposed framework for the DeciClare language was created, DeciClareEngine, and demonstrated with the realistic arm fracture case. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Business process engine; Declarative and data-aware process execution; Flexible information systems; Knowledge-intensive processes","Enterprise resource management; Information systems; Information use; Modeling languages; Patient treatment; Systems engineering; Automatic discovery; Business Process; Business process management; Declarative models; Declarative process models; Design science methodologies; Knowledge intensive process; Process execution; Engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066822006

As a result, it will be important to foster employability counseling of engineering students leading to an understanding of why broad knowledge will help their employability. This study measures the effects of the convergence concept on students’ employability by calculating the proportion of major classes taken in the humanities and social sciences among all college classes taken. This study analyzed the impact of convergence education as well as academic performance such as grades and study abroad experience on employability using employability-course matched data on graduates from a college of engineering from 2008 to 2015. The results showed that the higher percentage of classes taken in business administration or economics, as well as the total GPA and participation in study abroad programs, the more positive the effect on getting a job. This result reflects the reality that companies that value professional engineers are beginning to prefer that they have not only a business-oriented mindset but knowledge about other fields so that they can deal with the complexities and rapid changes in modern society. Accordingly, fostering corporate human resources philosophies that advocate for broad education will not only increase productivity in the labor market but make a great contribution to the development of colleges. © 2019, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

Circular economy in agriculture deals with the production of agricultural commodities making an efficient use of resources and avoiding unnecessary waste and carbon emission generation. Disruptions in the production and supply of critical agricultural products can have serious negative repercussions for firms and consumers of the food supply chain. In recent decades, disruptions generated by natural disasters such as hurricanes, thunderstorms and floods have greatly impacted social communities and industrial sectors. Supply chain risks approaches are seen to contribute key elements to address the impacts of natural disaster toward the implementation of circular economy in agriculture, helping to prevent collapses in the production and supply of food. The purpose of this paper is to study and identify flood risk drivers and their effects on the sustainability of an agriculture supply chain in connection with a circular economy strategy. By using an extended Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis method combined with a multi-criteria decision analysis, the most essential flood drivers with a degree of importance are reported here. Then, the authors propose an Evaluation of Data based on average ASsessment method, to rank different agricultural projects that pretend to mitigate the flood risks and its impacts on crop areas. The application of this research lies within the framework of a real agricultural project founded by the European Commission Scientific Section, called RUC-APS. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use management science-based tools to address circular economy in agriculture. The authors propose a multi-criteria-based methodology to assess the risks of flooding in crops areas. To validate the proposed methodology, a case example from Spain is discussed to rank different agricultural projects that pretend to mitigate the flood risks and its impacts on crop areas. Findings: The proposed multi-criteria methodology confirmed a successful application to rank different agricultural projects that pretend to mitigate the flood risks and its impacts on crop areas. Organizations and firms in the agricultural business can use the methodology to identify risks drivers and to detect the best projects to mitigate the highest impacts of flooding risks in crops areas. Originality/value: The authors use supply chain risks approaches to address the impacts of natural disaster on the implementation of circular economy in agriculture. The authors propose a robust multi-criteria-based methodology to assess the risks of flooding in crops areas and we used to determine the best mitigating projects to face flooding risks on crop areas. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Circular economy; Flood and supply chain risk; Flood risk; Multi-criteria decision making; Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis; Supply risks; Sustainable agriculture; Sustainable supply chain",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064477547

The purpose of this article is to identify the main entrepreneurial competencies and to determine the role of a learning environment on the development of entrepreneurial competencies in students. This article uses methods of statistical analysis and a questionnaire survey. The survey involved 251 students of the Elabuga Institute of the Kazan Federal University. These bachelor’s students were majors in Economics, Management, Professional Education (by branches) and Applied Computer Science in Economics. The survey that was applied uses a Likert five-point scale. The research showed that the level of entrepreneurial competencies among the Economics and Management majors averages 60%, 10% higher than in students majoring in Professional Education and Applied Computer Science in Economics. The survey showed that students could hardly assess their strengths and weaknesses, they were not confident in their abilities and talents either (the average score for “self-confidence” was 11 ± 2 points). The strongest entrepreneurial competence was formed in Economics majors (31%), while the lowest indicators were found in students majoring in Professional Education (18%). Among the various components of entrepreneurial competence, all students have better formed personal competencies, such as initiative, persistence, effective communication, and a focus on efficiency. Professional competencies, such as seeking new business opportunities, using information and communication technologies, and assessing new business opportunities, are better developed in students majoring in Economics, Management and Applied Computer Science in Economics. The study showed a high correlation between the quality of the learning environment and the level of entrepreneurial competence. The quality of education and training affects the future development of specialists in the enterprise. Therefore, data in this study will be useful in forming entrepreneurial competence in students when creating an innovation-based learning environment in higher educational establishments. © 2019, Allied Business Academies.

This paper looks at how AI text analytics will succeed sentiment analysis and how it can identify additional customer emotion and intent by using concepts rather than simple keywords in its analysis. The paper also looks at how the most successful AI text analytics feature human-in-the-loop technology that optimises the combination of automation and human involvement. This makes the need for data scientists to run day-to-day models obsolete as the human input can come from the business user instead.

This study clarifies the terminology around data science, computational social science, big data, business intelligence, and analytics, and defines decision support projects. The study uses quantitative methods to empirically classify the project scopes, investigate the similarities and differences between the project types, and identify the critical success factors. The results suggest BI and big data analytics projects are differentiated based on analytics competence, proprietary algorithms, and distinctive business processes. They are significantly different for 19 of the 52 items evaluated. For big data analytics projects, many of the items are correlated with strategic benefits, while for BI projects they are associated with the operational benefits of cost and revenue performance. Project complexity is driven by the project characteristics for BI projects, while the external market drives the complexity of big data analytics projects. These results should inform project sponsors and project managers of the contingency factors to consider when preparing project plans. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Analytics; Big data; Business intelligence; Data science; Project management; Success factors","Advanced Analytics; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Competitive intelligence; Data Analytics; Data Science; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Information systems; Information use; Project management; Terminology; Analytics; Business Intelligence projects; Computational social science; Critical success factor; Operational benefits; Project characteristics; Quantitative comparison; Success factors; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063034504

The data were analysed using the special package for social sciences (SPPS). Pearson’s correlation coefficient and regression analysis were conducted. Sobel test was also conducted to confirm the mediating effect of opportunity for participation. The findings revealed that there is a positive relationship between training effectiveness (Kirkpatrick four levels) and potential entrepreneur’s performance. The regression analysis indicates that opportunity for participation has been a dominant factor of the relationship between training effectiveness and potential entrepreneur’s performance. The integration of a mediator in the frame contributes to the Kirkpatrick model in the extant training and development as well as entrepreneurship literature. Furthermore, policy makers and HR departments of business organisations will have more appreciation of how training can be appropriately evaluated more particularly, the on-the-job training for an improved performance.

Cyber-physical systems can be used to collect and share data for tracking, automation and control as well as evaluation and documentation. This has a wide-reaching impact on business models. Instead of a linear approach, concentrating on a single company, the focus needs to be on the complete production ecosystem represented by a dynamic and self-organized network, including the supply chain. The interconnectedness of the cyber-physical systems in these networks is rooted in the Internet of Things, but also shared business processes. Performance, stability, security as well as data integrity and access control hereby represent a major contributing factor, calling for a new concept of information processing systems. The blockchain is a distributed ledger combining cryptographic and game-theoretic concepts, which enable immutable transactions and automatic consensus of the parties involved about its state.

(European Journal of Operational Research, 2(6), pp. 429–444, 1978), later extended by Banker et al. (Management Science 30(9), pp. 1078–1092, 1984), with many variations of DEA models proposed since. DEA measures the production efficiency of a so-called Decision Making Unit (DMU) which consumes inputs to produce outputs. DEA is a particularly useful tool when there are multiple measures to be analysed in terms of DMU (or organisation) performance, allowing it to benchmark and identify comparable peers. DEA can incorporate different measures of multi-dimensional activities thus allowing for DMU complexity and is particularly useful for more ingrained analyses when investigating the effects of contextual or environmental factors on organisations’ performance. DEA has been applied in numerous areas including banking, education, health, transport, justice, retail stores, auditing, fighter jet design, research and development to name a few. DEA is based around a production model which assesses the efficiency of DMUs in turning inputs into outputs. This is done by comparing units with each other to identify the most efficient DMUs that define a frontier of best performance, which is used to measure the performance of non-efficient DMUs. This efficient frontier represents “achieved best performance” based on actual outputs produced and inputs consumed and thus provides a useful practical reference set for benchmarking and performance improvement. There are very few assumptions required in DEA and its non-parametric form avoids the need to consider alternative distribution properties. In this chapter we first describe the case of a Post and Banking Business, and then introduce DEA in the context of our case. Different DEA models and additional features are discussed. We give a brief outline of an open-source software tool for DEA and finally apply three different DEA models to the case study and discuss the results.

The articles published, and the disciplinary categorization of where they are published, are indicative of the changing disciplinary balance in SDSS, while the citation links of these papers illustrate the intellectual structure of the field. The analysis shows that despite conceptual links rooted in DSS, the field of SDSS developed largely independently from DSS, with little interaction between both. This is surprising, given the growing importance of spatial applications in DSS and an overlapping interest in business analytics and big data space-time analytics. The paper argues for greater interest in SDSS developments in the DSS field, including emergency response SDSS and public participation SDSS, as two forms of SDSS which extend DSS. © 2018 The Authors","Bibliographic analysis; Geographic Information Systems; Spatial Decision Support Systems","Artificial intelligence; Bibliographies; Big data; Geographic information systems; Information services; Bibliographic analysis; Bibliographic database; Business analytics; Emergency response; Intellectual structures; Public participation; Spatial applications; Spatial decision support systems; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055969051

This chapter provides an account of European fishing industry engagement with the discard issue prior to the LO and industry attitudes towards the LO. A discussion about discard management in Europe follows. The fishing industry had a consistent approach to discard management in the run-up to the LO enactment: they favoured fishery-specific discard reduction plans and were unanimously opposed to an outright 'discard ban'. Canvassing fishers' opinions from the North Sea (Denmark, France), Eastern and Western Mediterranean (Greece, Spain and France), the Celtic Sea (France, the UK and Ireland), Western English Channel (France) and the Azores between 2015 and 2018 reveals a consistent negative attitude towards the LO. We found that choke species are the main concern outside the Mediterranean Sea while in the Mediterranean region, the cost of disposal and the creation of a black market for juvenile fish are seen as the main negatives. Fishers recognise the necessity of reducing discards although zero discard fisheries are not seen as attainable. They favour a combination of selectivity improvements and spatial management as the best discard reduction measures. New measures to deal with intractable choke species problems are being sought by industry and Member State groups but the European Commission want existing measures to be utilised first. We discuss some potential consequences of negative stakeholders' attitudes towards this key element of EU fisheries management policy. These include control and compliance challenges, associated business reputation problems for the industry, a longer LO implementation timescale, and deterioration in the quality of scientific data about discards. © The Author(s) 2019.","EU landing obligation; Fisheries control; Fisheries governance; Industry-science collaboration; Stakeholder engagement; Top-down policy",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070196675

In spite of acquiring this advanced knowledge, our students are not always aware of the significant added value and the positive elements the master’s degree provides for their future professional careers. Moreover, we have observed that students regard the different subjects as isolated blocks of knowledge. To tackle these problems, we have carried out a learning experience based on the creation of a technology-based enterprise (TBE) through the development of a common project (CP). Drawing on project-based learning (PBL) methodology, the CP consists of the identification, development, and final oral presentation of a business model. It aims to utilize sensor data and analysis in different domains. The experience has been highly positive, reducing the gap between studies and business practice, and increasing coordination among teachers. A key issue is that all the subjects of the master’s degree are involved in this learning experience. In addition, results show a high level of satisfaction with the master’s degree, compared to other similar courses. © 2018 by the authors.

The main objective of the study was to assess and evaluate the extent at which licensed restaurants in the Kumasi Metropolis observe food safety and hygienic practices regulations in food provision. Fifty (50) respondents were drawn from the population under study, specifically from staff, managers and regulatory bodies including the Metropolitan Assembly. Primary data was collected from the three groups. Questionnaires were administered and in-depth interview was conducted. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyze data collected from the respondents in the survey. The study showed that customers in the selected restaurants were very much satisfied at the extent by which restaurants in the Kumasi Metropolis observe and apply the food safety and hygienic practices. It was also revealed that there is adequate evidence to show that formal education and professional training have a significant impact on food safety and hygienic practices of caterers and restaurant managers in the tourism industry in the Kumasi Metropolis. The study recommends that restaurants in the metropolis should be encouraged to sponsor their workers to enroll in some professional programmes to acquire more knowledge for the purpose of practicing food safety and hygiene in the restaurant business. It is further recommended that regulatory bodies should improve their performance by maintaining high standard of food hygiene. © Copyright IJHTS.","Food safety; Hygienic practices; Kumasi; Restaurants; Tourism",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049214801

We test the predictions of our model via evidence from two studies. Study 1 uses cross-sectional data from the U.S. General Social Survey (GSS) and examines the correlation between regional cohort self-employment and individuals’ attitudes for self-employment. Study 2 uses longitudinal data from the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey and examines the likelihood of transitioning into self-employment as a function of regional cohort entrepreneurship. Our results provide evidence that individuals who belong to regional cohorts with a greater proportion of entrepreneurs are more likely to express favorable attitudes toward self-employment and to enter into self-employment. Managerial Summary: A large literature in the social sciences indicates that people's preferences and actions are influenced by the behaviors of those around them. We find this is true when it comes to entrepreneurship. Specifically, we document that people who live in regions with higher proportions of entrepreneurs are more likely to express favorable attitudes toward self-employment and are more likely to start new business ventures. This suggests that people embedded in environments where there is a lot of entrepreneurial activity are more likely to “catch the bug” of self-employment, as they use already-established entrepreneurs in the region as a roadmap for their own thinking and action.

Design/methodology/approach: The study consists of a systematic quantitative literature review of academic articles indexed on the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The articles were reviewed based on the following features: research topic; conceptual and theoretical characterization; sources of data; type of data and size; data collection methods; data analysis techniques; and data reporting and visualization. Findings: Findings indicate an increase in hospitality and tourism management literature applying analytical techniques to large quantities of data. However, this research field is fairly fragmented in scope and limited in methodologies and displays several gaps. A conceptual framework that helps to identify critical business problems and links the domains of business intelligence and big data to tourism and hospitality management and development is missing. Moreover, epistemological dilemmas and consequences for theory development of big data-driven knowledge are still a terra incognita. Last, despite calls for more integration of management and data science, cross-disciplinary collaborations with computer and data scientists are rather episodic and related to specific types of work and research. Research limitations/implications: This work is based on academic articles published before 2017; hence, scientific outputs published after the moment of writing have not been included. A rich research agenda is designed. Originality/value: This study contributes to explore in depth and systematically to what extent hospitality and tourism scholars are aware of and working intendedly on business intelligence and big data.

Explored in the book are examples of world-class, leading enterprises in fields, such as the Internet, big data, artificial intelligence, green and low-carbon, modern supply chain and high-end service. According to some data, the rate of contribution to the economic increase of Beijing made by Zhongguancun rose to 36.8% in 2015 from 17.9% in 2010. More specifically, in 2015, nearly 40% of the economic increase in Beijing was contributed by Zhongguancun Science Park. By 2017, Zhongguancun fostered 650 gazelle enterprises and 70 unicorn companies. The book also uniquely provides readers with a panoramic interpretation of the environment for innovation and entrepreneurship in Zhongguancun. It is mainly divided into three parts: History of Zhongguancun, Data of Zhongguancun, Cases of Zhongguancun and Policies of Zhongguancun. Through the depiction of history, data, cases and policy, this book clarifies that in most cases, enterprises in Zhongguancun become successes by following such a road characterized by starting from scratch and by relying on science and technology innovation and expanding from small to big by virtue of the capital market.

However, during the last 10 years the PQ model was also applied in a series of large-scale, survey-based studies worldwide to classify individual modern-day researchers according to their research orientation and performance. This paper argues that such applications are inadequate to capture key characteristics of individual researchers, especially those within the heterogeneous ‘Pasteur type’ group who engage in ‘use-inspired’ basic scientific research. Addressing this shortcoming, Pasteur's Cube (PC) model introduces a new heuristic tool. Departing from a three-dimensional conceptual framework of research-related activities, the model enables a range of typologies to describe and study the large variety of academics at today's research-intensive universities. The PC model's analytical robustness was tested empirically in two interrelated ‘proof of concept’ studies: an exploratory survey among 150 European universities and a follow-up case study of Leiden University in the Netherlands. Both studies, collecting data for the years 2010–2015, applied a metrics-based taxonomy to classify individual academic researchers according to four performance categories: scientific publication output, research collaboration with the business sector, patents filings, and being engaging in entrepreneurial activities. The collective results of both studies provide more clarity on relevant subgroups of use-inspired researchers. The PC model can be used to guide empirical, metrics-based investigations of research activities and productivities, applies this approach to two case studies, and demonstrates the utility of the method while also reinforcing and enriching the growing body of literature showing that cross-sectoral and cross-functional research activities are more scientifically productive than research carried out in isolation of the context of use. Introducing the ‘Crossover Collaborator’ subtype helps to explain why Pasteur type researchers tend to outperform other types of researchers in terms of publication output and citation impact. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Application oriented science; Classification system; Human resources analytics; Science and innovation policy; University researchers","Engineering; Application-oriented; Classification system; Entrepreneurial activity; Research collaborations; Research intensive universities; Science and innovation; Scientific publications; University researchers; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047931024

A descriptive study was carried out, with 210 students from the Accounting Sciences course of two universities of the Itajaí Valley, Santa Catarina, and a quantitative data approach. Design/methodology/approach: To compose the sample, the academics who were attending from the third semester of the course and working in business organizations were exclusively selected. Data collection was carried out by means of a questionnaire. and the analysis was conducted with the aid of modeling of structural equations. Ten hypotheses were established to investigate the theoretical relations object of analysis and to reach the objective of the study, of which only three were refuted. Findings: The results showed an indirect relation between psychological capital and knowledge transfer, mediated by the acquired knowledge and the absorptive capacity of the students. It has been found that accounting academics transfer knowledge to the business organizations in which they work, which indicates that their experiences, skills and knowledge gained from the studies, are put into practice in their workplace. This transfer of knowledge depends on the knowledge acquired, the students’ absorptive capacity and, indirectly, on their psychological capital. In general, it was verified that motivational factors can contribute to the transfer of knowledge. Originality/value: In general, it was verified that motivational factors can contribute to the transfer of knowledge, however, unlike that found in other studies developed on the subject, these are not direct determinants to the transfer of knowledge, being elements predictors for it to occur learning through its acquisition, which will influence this transfer. Thus, in the sample investigated, the evidences found revealed that the motivation for learning indirectly influences the transfer of knowledge, through the acquired knowledge. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business organizations; Psychological capital; Transfer of knowledge",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054792998

In particular, several interconnected research questions were investigated: How did the conceptualisation of CSR change from 1970 to 2014? What is the general direction of the change? How does Islamic CSR emerge? Design/methodology/approach: An in-depth analysis was performed with the use of the data analysis tool available in the Web of Science. The study categorises CSR into four areas: business ethics and corporate governance; management; marketing; and others. The first three categories were based on the Chartered Association of Business Schools’ Academic Journal Guide 2010 and 2015 (UK). Findings: The findings reveal that 67.19 per cent articles have been published based on the ranked journals of Academic Journal Guide 2010 and 2015. The findings of the study will help to inform future areas of CSR. The top journals which published most articles from Academic Journal Guide 2015 are Journal of Business Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management. Practical implications: The findings suggest that the remit of sustainability from Islamic perspective is wider. Islamic marketing, as an area, remains largely in need of empirical research. The business communities should successfully integrate Muslim communities into their marketing strategies. Originality/value: To the best of the knowledge, this is the first study to explore citation analysis of general CSR literature and Islamic CSR.

This paper discusses the importance on Business Intelligence (BI) initiatives and today's challenges in implementing them. The concentration is on using proven practices of project management to reduce the failure rates of the Business Intelligence projects by evaluating currently existing Information Technology (IT) project process, Business Intelligence frameworks and a Project Vulnerability process in order to adopt some of the best project management practices that works for Business Intelligence projects. The paper studies currently existing processes and introduces a new concept which henceforth will be termed as 'Unified Business Intelligence Ecosystem' framework (UBIE). This research is based on various project management frameworks, those are proven to increase the efficiency of projects, and far-ranging sources of research on nature of Business Intelligence projects, personal observations and real-world Business Intelligence consulting experience. Research limitations/implications: Business Intelligence is a constantly developing field. Partial standardization and extensive availability and access to Business Intelligence resources has created many definitions and buzz words in the industry. The assumptions described in this research might seem arguable given the reader's experience in this field. Originality/value: The paper presents a different perspective to view and manage Business Intelligence projects. It encourages to interpret Business Intelligence projects as an ecosystem by combining technical, business and management aspect rather than separate, standalone entity. The aim of this research paper is to achieve Business Intelligence success by customizing Project Management (PM) practices to fit the unique need of Business Intelligence projects.

This enables developing a solution that reduces labour intensity and improves the customisation of teaching. Design/methodology/approach: This work is based on a single-case analysis of an undergraduate operations management course taught at a UK-based global top-50 business school. The research process follows the design science approach where a prior course design is analysed and a redesign is presented, refined and tested using data on student satisfaction. Findings: The course redesign is based on the flipped learning pedagogy, and uses a combination of process analysis and educational science perspectives. The redesign seems to provide the benefits to students without increasing labour intensity. The developed six-step systematic approach should reduce the labour intensity of university-level teaching operations, while providing additional possibilities for customisable in-class active learning. Research limitations/implications: The empirical findings from the single-case design cannot be directly generalised to other contexts. However, the developed six-step systematic approach for redesigning the university-level teaching process should be applicable to other teaching operations to drive value creation and improve processes. Originality/value: This study shows how the resource-constrained value creation of teaching operations can be improved systematically using process analysis perspectives.

What are these factors, which are responsible for the adoption of proactive environmental strategies which are beyond the requirement of extant laws? The power sector is a critical sector for the development of infrastructure in a developing economy like India. The emissions from the power sector are a cause of concern for the environmentalists and stakeholders. Some firms are observed to be more environmentally proactive than others even though the regulatory requirements are same. This paper aims to identify the determinants of the adoption of proactive environmental strategies in the power sector in India. The available studies are generalised and very few are sector-specific. No such research is carried out specifically for the power sector in India. Statistical tools like SPSS (Statistical Programme for Social Science) and AMOS (Analysis of Moment Structures) are used to analyse the quantitative data collected through a questionnaire-based survey from major power sector companies. Reliability and validity of data collected are checked using Exploratory Factor Analysis. Subsequently, Confirmatory Factor Analysis is applied to identify the determinants of adoption of proactive environmental strategies. The identified determinants are ranked using Structural Equation Modelling. The study identifies institutional pressure, performance improvement, business practices, and market pressure and benefits as determinants. Institutional pressure and performance improvement emerge as determinants which are ranked higher as compared to other two. The specific contribution of the study is to provide an understanding for the policymakers in Indian power sector to recognise these determinants in the formulation of policies and guidelines for environmental protection. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Factor analysis; Institutional pressure; Performance improvement; Power sector; Proactive environmental strategies; Structural equation modelling","Environmental management; Environmental protection; Environmental regulations; Multivariant analysis; Reliability analysis; Statistical mechanics; Surveys; Institutional pressures; Performance improvements; Power sector; Proactive environmental strategies; Structural equation modelling; Factor analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056233394

It has been established by literature that to keep growing especially in a developing economy like Nigeria, SMEs are key factors due to their resilience attitude propelled by their orientations. This study therefore assessed how the entrepreneurial orientation (EO) (innovativeness, risk-taking and pro-activeness) influenced the performance of exporting small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Lagos State Nigeria. It adopted a Descriptive research design via the structured survey instrument-questionnaire administered to a sample of 134 exporters handling non-oil export in medium and low-technology manufacture industries, mechanised agriculture and as suppliers of merchandise. The data collected were analysed using regression analysis with aid of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 23). The result of the descriptive data imply that entrepreneurial orientation works better when all the features are put to use as a whole than as individual, then the contributions will have greater impact on the performance of the firm. However, their innovativeness was low. Therefore, entrepreneurial innovativeness should be encouraged and enhanced by improving the domestic and foreign technological networking for competitive innovations in the foreign markets. Besides, entrepreneurship education should be promoted to permeate the socio-economic environment with attributes necessary for sustainable growth, the export production base should be upgraded technologically to enhance innovativeness, as well as stable and positive trade policies and regulations among other factors should be entrenched in the system to improve the socio-economic environment stressor. © 2018, Allied Business Academies.

Starting with gathering background information (in much the same way as preparing the introduction to a scientific paper), the book describes methods to analyse the data and to implement a communication plan. The book is a valuable resource for research scientists from any discipline, and for team leaders wanting to involve members of their team in developing their organization's strategy. © 2019 by World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

This literature, along with the articles in this special issue, demonstrate the importance of contextualization in understanding the motivations, processes, and outcomes of firms developing and utilizing CPC in global strategy. We argue that context-specific aspects of CPC, such as the political system in which the firm is operating, need to be incorporated more systematically to advance theory development globally. Future studies on CPC can advance this agenda through cross-country comparative research, deeper engagement with political science literature, linking CPC with other nonmarket strategies, and configurational analysis of the multidimensional context of CPC. Managerial Summary: Multinational companies not only compete in a market environment, they engage with political actors in both their home and host societies. This special issue brings together research that explores how companies use their corporate political connections (CPC) to achieve firm objectives. Each study takes a different approach to studying the phenomenon, informed by the national context of their empirical data. Together, these studies highlight the importance of CPC around the world. However, the variation in research approaches also highlights that the “how and why” of companies' development and utilization of CPC vary across cultures and political systems. In consequence, the development of managerial recommendations always needs to carefully consider the pertinent political context of the available empirical evidence. © 2018 Strategic Management Society","business-government relations; contextualization; corporate political connections (CPC); nonmarket strategy; political capabilities; political systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051300207

A further aim is to collect and analyze empirical evidence concerning the advantages and disadvantages of carpooling. Design/methodology/approach: A large-scale text analytics study has been conducted: the collection of the peoples’ opinions have been realized on Twitter by means of a dedicated web crawler, named “Twitter4J.” After their mining, the collected data have been treated through a sentiment analysis realized by means of “SentiWordNet.” Findings: The big data analysis identified the 12 most frequently used concepts about carpooling by Twitter’s users: seven advantages (economic efficiency, environmental efficiency, comfort, traffic, socialization, reliability, curiosity) and five disadvantages (lack of effectiveness, lack of flexibility, lack of privacy, danger, lack of trust). Research limitations/implications: Although the sample is particularly large (10 percent of the data flow published on Twitter from all over the world in about one year), the automated collection of people’s comments has prevented a more in-depth analysis of users’ thoughts and opinions. Practical implications: The research findings may direct entrepreneurs, managers and policy makers to understand the variables to be leveraged and the actions to be taken to take advantage of the potential benefits that carpooling offers. Originality/value: The work has utilized skills from three different areas, i.e., business management, computing science and statistics, which have been synergistically integrated for customizing, implementing and using two IT tools capable of automatically identifying, selecting, collecting, categorizing and analyzing people’s tweets about carpooling. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data analysis; Carpooling; Fuzzy logic; Sentiment analysis; Twitter","Big data; Data flow analysis; Efficiency; Fuzzy logic; Privacy by design; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Text mining; Web crawler; Automated collection; Business management; Carpooling; Design/methodology/approach; Economic efficiency; Environmental efficiency; Potential benefits; Twitter; Reliability analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045151860

While not solely suited for BSc curricula, capstones raise the employability of BSc graduates, whose market value is intrinsically inferior to their MSc correspondents, yet highly attractive thanks to shorter turn-around time. Designing a BSc curriculum in Computer Science after those premises requires balancing two forces. One is traditional content-centered teaching, which has many adepts and exerts higher pressure on the shorter duration of the study path. The other is learner-centered teaching, which promotes active teaching strategies, and makes room for capstone inserts. This paper discusses how the University of Padua went around that challenge designing its BSc curriculum in Computer Science in 2002, and critically assesses its outcome to date. 27 credit hours of the total 180 in the novel curriculum were devolved to a capstone project comprising an internship in business, whose critical review feeds the final exam. The capstone was organized as a two-staged progression: (a) the first leg being a preparatory, learning-for-work collaborative laboratory aimed at the acquisition of soft skills, and exposure to technology innovation challenges; and (b) the second leg promoting a learning-through-work individual internship. Evaluation of field data from 14 cohorts of graduates, from 07/2004 to 12/2017, shows that the BSc curriculum has met with the appreciation of students and employers, and it has served well the purpose of boosting the university-business dialogue. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Capstone project; Cooperative learning; Curriculum development; Higher education; University/business dialogue","Curricula; Education computing; Engineering research; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Students; Capstone projects; Cooperative learning; Curriculum development; Higher education; University/business dialogue; Engineering education",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052025541

Data-driven business models come in two forms: Firms either use the personal data of users to tailor their own offerings to them, or they sell the data to others who use it for their own ends. These models have different implications for the protection of consumers. While they are typically reasonably well-informed about the data they transmit to a particular firm, they have less control about whom their data is sold on to. Consumers are regularly confronted with a lot of privacy-relevant information and choices, but they struggle to make decisions that are in line with their stated privacy preferences. Therefore, regulation should address privacy design concepts that actually foster control. The right to data portability is one of the fundamentally new elements of the General Data Protection Regulation. However, its economic implications are potentially very complex and, under certain circumstances, data portability may not even be in the interest of consumers. Nevertheless, the strengthening of consumer rights may likewise support competition. The monetary value of data is difficult to calculate. But if consumers are interested in a fair profit share of personal data markets, policy makers may disregard their claims. One article highlights the transformation in the academic publishing industry (STM) from a traditional focus on publishing services to a new emphasis on data analytics by reconstructing and illustrating the mechanisms of data capitalism. It offers an explanation for the growing profitability and concentration of the STM industry despite the growing open science movement. © 2018, Springer Verlag.

Research, however, is rather focused on investigating single technologies in quite specific application domains and largely neglects the profound managerial challenges underlying Industry 4.0. Given the recent plea for a more active contribution from the management science community, we strive to establish Industry 4.0 as a challenging but promising field for management research, and aim to assist scholars in engaging with the topic. Therefore, we first gather and analyze extant contributions by means of a systematic literature review and synthesize the information gained into 18 managerial challenges of Industry 4.0 falling into six interrelated clusters: (1) strategy and analysis, (2) planning and implementation, (3) cooperation and networks, (4) business models, (5) human resources and (6) change and leadership. Considering that Industry 4.0 is still an emerging topic and publications may therefore not always be found in highly ranked journals, we aimed to increase the confidence in our findings and triangulated our data by conducting an online survey of industry experts and academics that allows us to qualify the identified challenges in terms of importance and future research need.

The importance of data analytics has also prompted growing literature to focus on the design of data analytics. However, the boundary conditions for data analytics in creating value have been largely overlooked in the literature. The objective of this article therefore is to examine the business value of data analytics usage and explore how such value differs in different market conditions. We rely on an online B2C platform as our empirical setting and obtain several important insights. First, both demand-side and supply-side data analytics usage has a positive effect on the performance of merchants. Second, when merchants’ product variety is high, the influence of usage toward demand-side data on performance is strengthened, whereas such impact is weakened for supply-side data analytics. Third, when competitive intensity is high, the performance implication of demand-side data analytics usage is strengthened, whereas such impact is not strengthened for supply-side data analytics.

Greater data availability from self-monitoring production equipment allows firms to empower individual workers on the shop-floor with powerful decision support solutions. To explore the potential of such solutions, we replicate an important manual leak detection process from high-tech composite manufacturing and augment the system with highly sensitive sensors. Based on this setup we illustrate the main steps and major challenges in developing and instantiating a predictive decision support system. By establishing a scalable and generic feature generation approach as well as leveraging techniques from statistical learning, we are able to improve the forecasts of the leak position by almost 90%. Recognizing that mere forecast information cannot be evaluated with respect to business value, we subsequently embed the problem in an analysis of the underlying searcher path problem. We compare predictive and prescriptive search policies against simple benchmark rules. The data-supported policies dramatically reduce the median as well as the variability of the search time. Based on these findings we posit that prescriptive analytics can and should play a greater role in assisting manual labor in manufacturing environments. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Data science; Internet of things; Manufacturing; Optimal search; Prescriptive analytics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040069244

The present study was extended from the previous one for the purpose of examining the factors affecting the learning enjoyment. The samples were collected using the questionnaire in the ERP class of business students (non-IT learners) at Thai-Nichi Institute of Technology. The structural model was tested by the method of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Three constructs of learning enjoyment are derived from three perspectives, which are the learners' self-efficacy, the learner-ability-based teaching style of the instructors and the relaxed learning environment. From the data analysis, the valid model reveals that only the learners' self- efficacy has significantly a direct effect on the learning enjoyment while the other two constructs don't have. However, the teaching style of the instructors has a significant effect on the learners' self-efficacy, indicating that the ability-based teaching style has an indirect effect on the learning enjoyment through the learners' self-efficacy as a mediator. Consequently, the non-IT learners can perceive the learning enjoyment as they can build their self- efficacy in using ERP software while the instructors play as supportive roles to assist the non-IT learners. The significant factors found in the study can be practically considered to enhance the software training effectiveness in the company. © 2018 IEEE.","Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP); Learning Enjoyment; Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)","Computer aided instruction; Engineering education; Enterprise resource planning; Enterprise software; Industrial research; Social sciences computing; Enterprise resource planning (ERP); Learning achievement; Learning Enjoyment; Learning environments; Perceived ease of use; Structural equation modelling (SEM); Structural modeling; Technology acceptance model; Learning systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050149162

Big data and the use of data analytics are being adopted more frequently, especially in companies that are looking for new methods to develop smarter capabilities and tackle challenges in the dynamic processes. Working with big data and applying a series of data analysis techniques require strong multidisciplinary skills and knowledge of statistics, econometrics, computer science, data mining, law and business ethics, etc. Higher education institutions (HEIs) are concerned by this phenomenon which is also changing learning needs and require a reorientation toward the development of novel approaches and advancements in their programs. The purpose of this paper is to introduce and define big data analytics as having an immense potential for generating value for businesses. In this context, one prominent strategy is to integrate big data analytics in educational programs to enrich student’ understanding of the role of big data, especially those who want to explore their entrepreneurial ways and improve their effectiveness. So, the main purpose of this article consists, on the one hand, in why HEIs must carefully think about how to provide powerful learning tools and open a new entrepreneurship area in this field, and, why, on the other hand, future entrepreneurs (students) have to use data analytics and how they can integrate, operationally, analytics methods to extract value and enhance their professional capabilities. Design/methodology/approach: The author has established an expert viewpoint to discuss the notion of data analytics, identify new ways and re-think what really is new, for both entrepreneurs and HEIs, in the area of big data. This study provides insights into how students can improve their skills and develop new business models through the use of IT tools and by providing the ability to analyze data. This can be possible by bringing the tool of analytics into the higher educational learning system. New analytics methods have to help find new ways to process data and make more intelligent decisions. A brief overview of data analytics and its roles in the context of entrepreneurship and the rise of data entrepreneur is then presented. The paper also outlines the role of educational programs in helping address big data challenges and transform possibilities into opportunities. The key factors of implementing an efficient big data analytics in learning programs, to better orientate and guide students’ project idea, are also explored. The paper concludes with suggestions for further research and limitations of the study. Findings: The findings in this paper suggest that analytics can be of crucial importance for student entrepreneurial practice if correctly aligned with their business processes and learning needs and can also lead to significant improvement in their performance and quality of the decisions they make. The added value of big data is the ability to identify useful data and turn it into usable information by identifying patterns and exploiting new algorithms, tools and new project solutions. So, the move toward the introduction of big data and analytics tools in higher education addresses how this new opportunity can be operationalized. Research limitations/implications: There are some limitations to this research paper. The research findings have significant implications for HEIs in the field of analytics (mathematics and computer science), and thus, it is not generalizable with any further context. Also, the viewpoint is centered on the data analytics process as a value generator for entrepreneurial opportunities. Originality/value: This research can be considered as a contribution with literature about educational quality, entrepreneurship and big data analytics. This study describes that new analytics thinking and computational skills are needed for the newer generation of entrepreneurs to handle the challenges of big data. But, preparing them to capture, analyze, store and manage the large amounts of data available today – so they can see value in data – is not just about implementing and using new technologies. This is also, about, a dynamic, operational and modern educational learning process from which a student can extract the maximum benefit. In another words: How to make new opportunities from these data? Which data to select for the analysis? and How to efficiently apply analytical techniques to generate value? © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data; Data analytics; Education institutions; Entrepreneurship; Learning; Value creation","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Data Analytics; Economics; Education computing; Learning systems; Statistics; Students; Design/methodology/approach; Education institutions; Entrepreneurial opportunities; Entrepreneurship; Higher education institutions (HEIs); Learning; Multi-disciplinary skills; Value creation; Data mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046663313

During the last two decades, much academic effort from a variety of disciplines went into trying to understand, examine and predict these transformations. However, there are no in-depth studies on these profound social and cultural changes as exemplified in global scientific productions. Using a bibliometric approach, we present a comprehensive study of the image of the social sciences in Iran based on the search item “Iran’s Social Sciences” in the Web of Science (WoS). The data were collected from Web of Science’s Core Collections between 2000 and 2017 and was limited to document-type articles in the category of Social Science Citation Index (SSCI). Collection efforts resulted in 4,666 documents being retrieved. The majority of the documents were published in English and were written by Iranian authors. The results of this study show that international collaboration through networking and co-authorship was lower than the global average. In terms of content, health- and medical-related concepts and themes were dominant in overall publications. Given this remarkable insight, more collaboration between sociologists in Iran with scholars from other countries is needed to better highlight the desired issues and topics. Further research might focus on the current ‘business models’ of publishing. While we advise launching more scientific journals at the global level, it is important to evaluate whether international business models of publishing are really encouraging or if they pose unnecessary bias and restrictions on knowledge development and participation of Iranian world-class sociologists. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Bibliometric; Image; Scientific production; Social sciences; Sociologists",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049344875

The aim of this study is to analyze the current practice and performance of KODISA journals and develop strategies that will continuously meet and respond to the changes and success in the future. Research design, data, and methodology - This is a case study, an analytical approach, which focuses on analyzing current and previous strategies, practices, and performances of the four major journals of KODISA and the association. The organizational structure, including election and terms of KODISA officers, new membership, and members of editorial board, is discussed and analyzed. The citation, submission, publication, and rejection rates of all four journals are examined, and the progress, including the status of indexing of each journal, is discussed. Results - The analysis indicates that KODISA has significantly invested its resources into improving its journals and attracting new members. The analysis also shows the strategy of the organizational structure, which includes election and terms of officers and editorial board members that implemented over the years, was successful. Both Journal of Distribution Science (JDS) and Journal of Finance, Economics, and Business (JAFEB) are indexed in SCOPUS, with East Asian Journal of Business Management (EAJBM) in the final stage of the SCOPUS indexing evaluation, and International Journal of Industrial Distribution and Business (IJIDB) will complete and submit their indexing evaluation materials to SCOPUS this summer. Conclusions - The success and progress of KODISA and its journals clearly support the need for continuous development, analysis, revision, and implementation of strategies. Based on the analysis, conducting the annual performance reviews of the association and its journals and planning and strategizing based on the reviews since 2011 have greatly contributed to the overall success. In terms of meeting the short term strategy, KODISA has to continue developing relationships with relevant and appropriate scholarly/academic associations to expand the scope of its business, establishing independence of each journal and its respective procedures and practices and improving the quality of the journals and their publications through KODISA's international conferences. © 2013 NRF.","And Business (JAFEB); East Asian Journal of Business Management (EAJBM); Economics; International Journal of Industrial Distribution and Business (IJIDB); Journal of Distribution Science(JDS); Journal of Finance; Korea Distribution of Science Association (KODISA)",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047849301

Our purpose is to conduct a comprehensive and objective research into how the public use of Big Data from web searches has affected research, and furthermore, to discuss the implications of Google Trends in terms of Big Data utilization and application. To this end, we conducted a network analysis on 657 research papers that used Google Trends. We also identified the important nodes of the networks and reviewed the research directions of representative papers. The study reveals that Google Trends is used to analyze various variables in a wide range of areas, including IT, communications, medicine, health, business and economics. In addition, this study shows that research using Google Trends has increased dramatically in the last decade, and in the process, the focus of research has shifted to forecasting changes, whereas in the past the focus had been on merely describing and diagnosing research trends, such as surveillance and monitoring. This study also demonstrates that in recent years, there has been an expansion in analysis in linkage with other social Big Data sources, as researchers attempt to overcome the limitations of using only search information.

BDA is especially relevant to the domain of Supply Chain Management (SCM) as it provides the tools to support decision-making in increasingly global, volatile and dynamic value networks. However, its application challenges traditional institutional arrangements as well as roles that are related to the management of data. The underlying empirical study addresses this challenge with the application of a multi-method approach that is embedded in Organizational Information Processing Theory (OIPT). A Delphi survey was conducted to integrate expert assessments of projections up to the year 2035 and fuzzy c-means clustering was applied to identify future scenarios that span the future of BDA in SCM. The study suggests that BDA will improve demand forecasts, reduce safety stocks and improve the management of supplier performance. However, supply chain (SC) processes will become increasingly automated and traditional tasks of SCM will be partially substituted as a result. Consequently, the transition of the traditional role of SCM within organizations will increase the importance of human intuition, trust and strategic decision-making. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Big Data Analytics; Delphi method; Fuzzy logic; Organizational Information Processing Theory; Supply Chain Management","Big data; Decision making; Fuzzy logic; Management science; Business intelligence applications; Data analytics; Delphi method; Fuzzy C means clustering; Institutional arrangement; Organizational information processing; Strategic decision making; Supply chain managements (SCM); Supply chain management; Delphi analysis; future prospect; fuzzy mathematics; information processing; social impact; supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032332731

This topic has had little exploration in the social sciences and this study helps bridge that gap by investigating the challenge of adopting innovations based on the Internet of Things (IoT), more specifically factors that affect the adoption decision. The realization of the vision of IoT still requires more investment in research and development because of its novelty and complexity. Beyond the technical issues, large-scale adoption is also hampered by the lack of clarity regarding which factors influence the adoption decision of these technologies. The theme adoption of innovation is relevant to those who develop an innovation and want it to be adopted as well as to those who have to decide whether to adopt an innovation or not. As the adoption rate is influenced by factors and decisions that lie both on the side of the supplier as well as the adopter of a technological innovation, this work is based on studies that seek to integrate variables from both sides in order to reflect the systemic nature of this process. Given the nature and novelty of the technology whose adoption is the object of this study, the chosen methodology was multiple case studies, exploratory and qualitative in nature. For the case studies, a total of 8 interviews were conducted and the collection of data was complemented with internal documentation which included executive summaries and detailed information on project execution. The proposed model looked at 4 dimensions: external, internal, technological, and supplier. The first objective was to apply the model to both case studies in order to identify and analyze the key factors influencing the adoption decision for the Internet of things in each company. The second objective was to do a deeper analysis on how the factors related to the technological dimension affected the adoption decision. A comparative analysis was also developed for a deeper understanding of how nuances related to each case may have contributed to the findings, whether these were similar or divergent. What the research has shown is that the model and its factors helped to organize the key issues for analysis in the adoption decision process, serving as support for future studies related to business modelling of IoT solutions. Given the case study methodology, the results cannot be generalized. The proposed model can be applied to both suppliers and adopters of the technological innovation, integrating factors that are external and internal to the company, as well as factors of the IoT technology and factors of the supplier. The model can be easily adapted to serve as a tool in the evaluation and eventual selection of technological innovations. © 2018 Towards Sustainable Technologies and Innovation - Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2018.

However, few studies have been conducted by analysing the references of publications with a visual pattern. Moreover, this subject has reached a certain degree of maturity; hence, a review that analyses the trends of organisational culture is urgent. Aim: The aim of this study was to provide broad information on organisational culture, including authors, journals, countries and references. In addition, the evolution of organisational culture is depicted and potential future research focuses are predicted. Setting: Using the Web of Science as a data source, we captured 1479 publications in science citation index (SCI) and social science citation index (SSCI) from 2005 to 2016 with 63 682 corresponding references for analysis. Methods: A bibliometric approach using CiteSpace software was applied to quantitatively and visually analyse organisational culture. Results: (1) The USA is the most productive country followed by the UK and then Australia in terms of publication; (2) scholars are mainly focused on ‘performance’, ‘innovation’ and ‘knowledge management’ aspects; (3) most fundamental theories and frameworks were created from the 1980s to the 1990s; (4) the Journal of Business Ethics is the most appropriate journal for contributions, whereas the Academy of Management Review is suitable for scholars to do a literature review, construct a theoretical framework and develop a research design; and (5) future research on this f﻿﻿ield has been justified accordingly. Conclusion: These findings not only provide basic background knowledge about organisational culture for new researchers but also provide a framework for visual and quantitative research to management scholars and fill the gap between organisational culture and bibliometric analysis. © 2018.

It is based primarily on anonymised interviews with banks, cloud providers, advisers, and financial services regulators. The findings are presented in three parts. Part 1 explored the extent to which banks operating in the EU, including global banks, use public cloud computing services. Part 2 of this paper covers the main legal and regulatory issues that may affect banks’ use of cloud services. It sets out how EU banking regulators have approached banks’ use of cloud services and considers regulators’ lack of cloud computing knowledge. The paper further considers how the regulation of outsourcing applies to banks’ use of cloud services, including whether cloud computing constitutes “outsourcing”. It analyses the contentious issue of contractual audit rights for regulators as well as legal and practical issues around risk assessments, security, business continuity, concentration risk, bank resolution, and banking secrecy laws.

It is able to model varied data behaviour and hence provides a flexible alternative to the most usual distributions. The family includes Birnbaum–Saunders and log-Birnbaum–Saunders distributions in univariate and multivariate versions. There are now well-developed methods for estimation and diagnostics that allow in-depth analyses. This paper gives a detailed review of existing methods and of relevant literature, introducing properties and theoretical results in a systematic way. To emphasise the range of suitable applications, full analyses are included of examples based on regression and diagnostics in material science, spatial data modelling in agricultural engineering and control charts for environmental monitoring. However, potential future uses in new areas such as business, economics, finance and insurance are also discussed. This work is presented to provide a full tool-kit of novel statistical models and methods to encourage other researchers to implement them in these new areas. It is expected that the methods will have the same positive impact in the new areas as they have had elsewhere. © 2018 by the authors.

The data was collected using questionnaire from final year students of entrepreneurship and computer sciences enrolled in Bachelors, so as to get a profound picture of their intention, motivation and ability to enter in IT related entrepreneurial ventures. As descriptive statistics was used to analyze the findings, the study depicts great motivation among final year graduates to enter in entrepreneurial ventures. They are found to be motivated to establish ventures of their own even at small level. Therefore, SMEs can play vital role in assisting and fostering entrepreneurial activity with special focus on Information Technology businesses. In addition, the research limitation could be the fact that data has been collected from top universities/ institutes in which intellect level of students is competitively high, thus their liking to entre and understanding regarding SMEs and entrepreneurial initiatives is better than students of ordinary institutes. Also, the results could have been deviated if same research was applied in countries with varying demographics. As for practical implementations, the research may be vital for SMEs officials to foresee the entrepreneurial spirit among youth and to design policies accordingly. Also, it opens horizons for information Technology students to consider entrepreneurial careers other than simply applying for jobs in software houses/organizations. Also, no prior research has been carried out in analyzing the mutual relation of Entrepreneurship and Information Technology businesses, neither the outcome/ joint effect of both has been studied together. © 2018 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.","Economic crisis; Entrepreneurship; Global entrepreneurship monitor; Information technology; Innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045014977

Design/methodology/approach: The data collected in this study were collected through a review of empirical literature based on 35 articles published between 1998 and 2013. The sample articles on the link between external factors and the level of voluntary disclosure were located by searching keywords in the most relevant social science research databases such as Business Source Premier, Emerald full text, JSTOR, Science Direct, Scopus, and Social Science Research Network. Findings: The result reveals that research in voluntary disclosure practices by companies in emerging countries remains low. The majority of studies employed content analysis to examine the extent of voluntary disclosure practices. Results from studies show that greater regulatory enforcement in the region and increase in stakeholders’ comprehension about their rights and choices with regards to business activities can influence the majority of the companies to provide voluntary disclosure. The literature revealed that social responsibility and environmental information are the popular categories of voluntary disclosure while risk and human capital/intellectual capital are the least popular categories. Research limitations/implications: The paper is limited to a review of 35 articles. Practical implications: The study provides avenues for policy makers and regulators to carry out reforms on voluntary disclosure practices. Social implications: The findings may provide insights to capital market regulators when conducting effective regulation and supervision of information transparency in listed companies. Originality/value: Since limited studies exist that examine voluntary disclosure in emerging countries, little is known about the implications of external factors such as a country’s policy, regulations, stakeholders, and business environment on voluntary disclosure practices. This paper contributes to filling this gap by a review of articles of empirical research on voluntary disclosure in emerging countries. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Emerging economies; External factors; Theories; Voluntary disclosure",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053458832

In the first decade of this century, two ministries of the Japanese government, Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, Science and Technology (MEXT), began independently implementing cluster policies for R&D consortia with the same purpose, though with contrasting policy designs. While private firms can play a leading role and obtain a considerable share of the METI subsidy, they are the subcontractors to the university partners, and thus, cannot gain a direct share of the MEXT subsidy. Focusing on the Japanese policies, we empirically investigate how participating firms' commitment toward R&D projects differs between these cluster programs and examine whether the firms' commitment enhances project performance (i.e., commercialization of R&D outcomes) using original and comparable survey data. The estimation results suggest that the participants of the METI program demonstrate a significantly higher commitment when compared to the participants of the MEXT program, and that project performance significantly depends on firm commitment. A major policy implication is that when commercialization is important for the government, it should consider firm commitment in policy design. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Allocation; Cluster policy; Commercialization; Commitment; R&D consortia; Subsidy","Distributed computer systems; Allocation; Cluster policy; Commercialization; Commitment; Subsidy; Public policy; cluster analysis; commercialization; comparative study; governance approach; innovation; policy approach; research and development; subsidy system; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025582619

Remarkably, there have been few evaluations of either their economic impact or their prospects for economic impact. The 2004 decision by California voters to issue bonds to fund $3 billion of research on human pluripotent stem cells is an ideal case study for introducing an evaluation methodology for the progress by state programs in developing and transferring research results. In the process of evaluating the California stem cell initiative, we make three methodological contributions to the study of the impacts of sub-national science-based economic development programs. First, the following data sources are introduced as indicators of the prospective economic benefits of these programs: changes in targeted federal research funding, patenting, small business investment research grants, venture capital investment, new firm formations, and clinical trials. Second, the use of regional or industrial controls is introduced. In the case study of the California stem cell initiative the regional control is the comparison of the two dominant California stem cell research and firm clusters, San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area, to the other dominant cluster, Boston. The biotechnology industry, as a whole, is used to control for exogenous shocks such as changes in the overall interest in new life science technologies. Third, because technology transfer is predicated upon commercialization, a value chain perspective can visualize commercialization obstacles. In this study, a stylized human stem cell therapy value chain is compared to the existing biotechnology value chain and the differences suggest areas where human stem cell therapies are likely to face difficulties. The discussion and conclusion evaluates the progress of the California stem cell initiative and suggests that the evaluation methodology developed can improve the evaluation and guidance of science-based economic development programs. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","California Institute for Regenerative Medicine; Commercialization; Evaluation; Regenerative medicine; Research goal setting; Stem cells","Biotechnology; Cells; Chains; Cytology; Economic and social effects; Economics; Investments; Technology transfer; California institute for regenerative medicines; Commercialization; Evaluation; Regenerative medicine; Research goals; Stem cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018457607

It describes a new way of thinking about and engaging with business models as patterns. The term “business pattern” is used to refer to a coherent and repeating sequence of action involving humans, machines (including information technologies systems) and artifacts (such as data structures) as a way of organizing a firm. The study also describes a way of visualizing either existing business patterns or envisaged business patterns through the design artifact of a pattern comic. This is used to provide a narrative of some business pattern in principle or in practice. The design theory of a business pattern as well as the design artifact of a pattern comic offer a range of contributions to the literature on business models. First, they permit a clearer distinction to be drawn between business model, business motivation, and business strategy. Second, they suggest a clearer way of building models of “business” (organizing) either as currently conceived (as-is) or in terms of envisaged models (as-if). This also allows clearer expression of business motivation in terms of transitions between as-is and as-if business patterns. Third, business patterns offer a practical way of thinking about the reuse of business models as patterns and their potential for benchmarking purposes. To help ground both the theorization and the visualization proposed we apply the design theory of a business pattern and the design artifact of pattern comics to help make sense of the domain of online grocery.

Especially relevant is the analysis regarding field of study, which has not been addressed in the underemployment literature. Using data from the Spanish Labour Force Survey 2006–2014, bivariate probit selection models are estimated for three different periods. This methodology enables to analyse the evolution of underemployment among young people, simultaneously considering their probability of employment. The results indicate that underemployment is negatively related to education level for each period and tertiary education has smoothed the negative effect of the recession. Moreover, those specialisations that provide students with specific and work-oriented skills (sciences, technology and health) help workers avoid underemployment and enable them to handle the recession better. Conversely, more generally oriented fields (education, and arts and humanities) are associated with a higher probability of underemployment. Similar patterns have been found regarding unemployment, indicating education plays a similar role in both working time shortages. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","business cycle; Education level; field of study; underemployment and employment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032375292

Methodology - The system management of the process of creating and mastering the production of a new product is based on effective change management, development of organizational and technical management systems, business-to-business interaction systems, business solutions relating to product creation in the industry. Systemization of problems and identification of ways of development of theory and methodology of creation of a new product by the domestic manufacturing companies can be performed by means of implementation of continuous acquisition and life cycle support (CALS) systems. Results - Today, the fundamental conceptual basis for the formation of information space of an enterprise and application of miscellaneous information systems is the concept of continuous information support of products throughout the entire life cycle - CALS. According to this concept, one can single out the following major objectives which are essential for an enterprise and can be achieved through information technologies: the automation of production management which was conventionally achieved through the use of MICS systems, and today it is achieved due to the use of the so-called ERP/CRM/SCM systems; product data management and automation of design and engineering analysis of structures and processes (PDM/PLM, CAD/CAM/CAE-system); information support of operation and aftersales service, integrated logistic support of products. The information technologies at the present stage are a prerequisite for achieving a competitive advantage by an enterprise, particularly if the enterprise is specialized in the production of hightechnology products. The major purpose of information technologies at the enterprise is the maximum effective support of design processes, production processes and other processes running at the enterprise, creation of the information basis which enables the management to take decisions which help the enterprise to achieve a dominant position in the industry sector. For Russian companies, the problem of implementation and effective employment of CALS-technologies as a means of cardinal improvement in quality and competitiveness of science-intensive products, discussed in the chapter, is extremely topical. Conclusions - For many companies, the employment of these technologies largely determines the ability to survive in the context of an intensifying competitive struggle in the domestic market and can be considered as an indispensable condition for maintaining and expanding the sales of products on the international market. © 2018 Emerald Publishing Limited.","CALS-system; CALS-technologies; Change management; Economy; Informatization; Integration of production systems; Product",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131465486

The variety, velocity, veracity, and volume of a typical twentieth-century business data and traditional technology are contrasted against the twenty-first-century business data and innovative technology. The final hypothesis is that big data revolution intertwined with analytics is an innovation that is transforming business. Therefore, there is a need for more businesses to adopt and benefit from big data technology. After close and critical review of big data technology intertwined with analytics, it is argued that a fruitful approach would be the development of a suitable Information Technology and Computer Science academic courses that would reflect big data technology. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Big data; Business; Information technology; Traditional technology",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125407087

With its focus on the context of small firm internationalisation, this study assesses the important contribution of strategic determinants that influence export performance, considering the mediating effect of competitive strategy. Based on survey data from Portuguese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) findings suggest that entrepreneurial orientation has a positive and significant influence on differentiation and export performance. Moreover, the results also highlight the role of intangible resources in the design of both differentiation and cost leadership strategies, which drives export performance. Finally, absorptive capacity is highly related with differentiation and export performance. This study deepens our understanding and provides novel insights into entrepreneurship and strategic management literature, since it combines multiple factors and has obtained the importance of each construct in SMEs competitive strategies and business growth.

The case consists of an interview with the female founder which focuses on the establishment of her business and illustrates her occupational life. In addition, her diary account from past to present provides a closer look at the thoughts and attitudes of a mompreneur. Sabine Jotter, one of four founders of the business presented and a mother of two, wanted to push for big budgets for her company. After a few years of freelancing, her “hunting” instinct was aroused, causing her at times to feel like an uncaring mother. On most days however, she is satisfied with the flexibility, independence, and leadership role she enjoys as part of her work. Using the jigsaw approach, the teaching material below is divided into four “pieces” to help bring students and complementary data together. In doing so, different perspectives on entrepreneurial success are discussed, and light is shed on the role of the woman and mothers in France and Germany. Perceived motivational factors also play a key role. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Businesswoman; Entrepreneurial motives; Female entrepreneurs; Gender aspects; Humanities and social sciences; Mompreneur; Success",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078767885

First, the problem of definition: which term is appropriate to define new technologies; and second, what principles and methods are appropriate to classify a certain technology as new or emerging. Locally, this problem is also relevant, because the definitions of new technologies and the actual technologies are rarely discussed by Lithuanian researchers. To fill this gap, exploratory research has been conducted to compare definitions and the technological content of new technologies in international policy documents and the corporate websites of global corporations leading in research and development investments. Focusing on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Commission (EC), a policy document analysis showed that the term high technology, which dominated the discourse in the 1980s and well into the 1990s, has since been eclipsed by innovations and sustainable development, moving from an economy-centered approach to a focus on the qualitative aspects of technology development and its social impact. Within policy documents, various quantitative variables are applied to measure technology development at the level of regions, states or specific technological fields, such as the intensity of investments in research and development or the fields in which explosive growths of worldwide patents occur. However, a variety of methodological implications limit the use of this data to map the emergence and the potential impact of more specific technologies, rather than wide fields of development. The website content of globally operating corporations known for being the leaders of business investment in R & D shows that the corporate discourse focuses on a rhetoric of progress and global impact as the main driving force of technological development. Commercially prospective technologies, as presented on corporate websites, emerged in the following seven technological fields in 2017: pharmaceutics and biotechnology, software engineering, web technologies, social research, electronic engineering, telecommunications, and transportation. This method offers the advantage of analyzing both specific technologies and the broader technological fields they belong to. Also, in contrast to policy documents, the list of new technologies in the corporate context offers several significant insights into the interdisciplinary nature of technological development and the contribution of the major technological fields to overall technological development. Overall, the list highlights the ties between micro- (individual level) and macro-level (society and state) technological impact, the interplay of visible (end-user products) and invisible (infrastructure) elements of technological systems. The results reflect the specifics of commercial settings, where new technologies are at a stage of development following fundamental scientific research and preceding mass production and distribution of innovations. The differences between technology discourse in policy documents and corporate communication are reflective of a wider split into expert and public discourse, characteristic of the different aims pursued by the respective agents. Findings about the definitions and classifications of new technologies presented in this article may be applied for policy-making in the areas of science, technology and innovation management, research of the social impact of technologies, and critical discussions of the ethical, legal, social and economic implications of technology development before their mass adoption. © 2018 Maryja Šupa.Šis straipsnis nagrine˙ja dvejopa problema, su kuria susiduria naujuju technologiju tyre˙jai - kaip apibre˙žti naujasias technologijas ir kokiu principu konkrečias technologijas priskirti būtent naujuju technologiju kategorijai.

Featuring data from the USA, the UK, India, China, Mexico and other countries, the author links NMS to economic freedom, regional development, corruption and other national factors. Nonmarket strategy (NMS) refers to any part of a firm’s strategy that seeks to generate superior performance through means not directly associated with market activity, such as lobbying legislators, colluding with rivals to erect industry entry barriers and pursuing direct business-government partnerships. Decades ago, nonmarket factors comprised a minor, peripheral consideration in organizational strategy. Today, NMS is central to strategy development and execution. This phenomenon is driven by both corruption in emerging economies and cronyism in the developed world. Scholarly interest in NMS continues to increase and while much is known about the topic, some core questions still remain such as: Are there different drivers for and implications of proactive NMS versus defensive NMS? How do national environments influence firm decisions to pursue NMS? The data presented in the book explores many of these questions. Providing a comprehensive, multidisciplinary analysis that includes elements of management, economics, philosophy and social sciences, this book is beneficial for scholars, practitioners, students, academics and policy makers interested in NMS. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.","Corporate political analysis; Corruption; NMS in China; NMS in Ghana; NMS in Mexico; NMS in the UK; NMS in the USA; Non-market strategy (NMS); State-owned enterprises (SOEs); Strategic political management",,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064363539

Three major trends, not in the same direction, were detected. First, university access has been democratized, with an increase in the relative share of women, blacks, browns, and indigenous people. In the general population, 9.4% of the women and 7.2% of the men had a college degree in 2010. Whites were 95% of the college graduates in 1960; in 2010, they represent three out of four graduates - although whites are less than half the Brazilian population. Second, this inclusion does not imply equal access to all university careers; it took place more intensely in fields less valued by the labor market. Brazil has a stratification pattern similar to that of the United States: education, humanities, and health - with Medicine as an outlier - are fields with a larger concentration of women, while careers related to business, engineering, and technology attract more men. In terms of race, there is a higher concentration of brown and black people in careers in applied social sciences and humanities and especially in the field of Religion. Finally, inferential analysis revealed persistent wage inequalities. Women with university degrees still earn less than her male counterparts in the same career, despite the decrease in the wage gap. More dramatically, disadvantages related to race fluctuated but did not undergo significant changes throughout these decades. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.","Affirmative action; Gender inequalities in education; Higher education; Horizontal stratification in education; Race inequalities in education",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063429431

Traditional tools, such as individual (univariate) financial ratios and trend analyses, proved to have lag indicators whereas modern tools, such as quantitative statistical models, have a prediction power and searching for fraudulent practices in businesses. Two models of the independent variable, two types of fraudulent practices of the dependent variable, and one moderating variable were stated. The study adopted a descriptive and analytical approach by analyzing financial statements of a sample of 11 Syrian banks using statistical approaches to test the research hypotheses. Data of this research were gathered based on a series period from 2010-2014, and processed using the statistical package of social sciences (SPSS). The main results of the study are (1) There are impacts of financial analysis tools represented by LEAM2003 and the MJ1995 models on detecting fraudulent practices in listed banks at Damascus stock exchange. This is explained by the existence of many accounting distortions leading to fraudulent accounting practices, such distorting expenses and revenues classifications and deferring these items for future periods (fraud accounting) or recognizing recurring and nonrecurring future expenses this year with the aim of reducing the current year income (big bath accounting), exploiting the flexibility of IFRS and twitting governance procedures and instructions. (2) There is a positive relationship between the bank size and fraudulent practices where management and accountants of banks are able to conceal accounting treatments in order to accommodate local environments. (3) It is more suitable for the Syrian context to apply quantitative statistical models that are more effective in detecting accounting fraudulence compared with behavioral implications and other non-statistical models.

This paper focuses on knowledge generation and the way in which it is transferred from universities to industry. Most well reputed universities have several departments and university-run enterprises that engage in research. The purpose of these research units is to help universities provide breakthrough innovation through the generation of new knowledge. Problem Statement. For this we chose to study China's University Technology Transfer Offices (UTTOs) to gather concrete evidence of university knowledge generation for commercial use in industry. The objective of this study is get indepth information about the role of UTTOs in the transfer of such knowledge. Purpose. The generation of new knowledge contributes to the field of science and technology; in turn, industry can use this knowledge to produce new innovative products or improve existing ones. This study aims to identify the process of knowledge transfer from universities to industry in China. Materials and Methods. Our study was carried out as a qualitative case study in the Anhui province of China. Data was mainly collected through semi-structured interviews with technology transfer experts working in technology transfer offices. Collected data were analyzed using a knowledge transfer model with six phases: 1) awareness, 2) acquisition, 3) transformation, 4) association, 5) application, and 6) feedback. Results. In China, universities and their research groups dominate in the generation and commercialization of research results, with UTTOs acting as technology bridges between the two parties, as well as providing legal and business services. Conclusions. This paper contributes by offering a detailed description of the knowledge transfer process and specifically the role and activities of UTTOs.

From a methodological perspective, the research is based on Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality and the dynamic panel regression methodology, based on adapted growth model. The empirical evidence is performed on unbalanced annual panel data of eight selected countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic and Slovenia), during the period 1995-2016. The research confirms that there is a trend to combine direct and indirect public funding instruments. Because of limited financial resources, indirect support has become more important in recent years. Cash grants and tax deduction are the tools most often used for support and funding of R&D in the selected CEE countries. A dynamic panel analysis with fixed effects confirms a positive and statistically significant impact of R&D expenditure on economic growth. Government R&D expenditure is reported to be a key driver for economic performance followed by business R&D expenditure, a higher share of persons with tertiary education and/or employed in science and technology and country openness. On the contrary, investment and higher education R&D expenditure were found to have a positive but statistically insignificant impact. Hence, special care of policymakers should be given to investment mix. It is decisive to direct and support investment to growth-enhancing areas (e.g. infrastructure and communication, R&D, education and health care) and to improve the ratio between current and capital investment. Attention should also focus on higher education R&D support, and future development must be concentrate on its cooperation with business sector especially in the area of applied research. Finally, a crisis is reported to have a negative and statistically significant impact on economic growth. © 2018, Technical University of Liberec.

The objective was to determine the role of buyer–supplier relationships in achieving economic sustainability in the private telecommunication sector in Zimbabwe. The target population of this research was composed of private telecommunication companies in Zimbabwe. This study employed simple random sampling technique where a sample size of 76 procurement staff was selected to participate in this research as respondents; these were procurement managers, procurement officers, buyers and procurement clerks. The independent variables for buyer–supplier relationships were transactional types of relationships, collaborative relationships and strategic alliances relationships. On the other hand, the dependent variable was economic sustainability of private telecommunication companies in Zimbabwe. This study was a survey of private telecommunication companies in Zimbabwe and primary data were gathered by the use of self administered closed-ended questionnaires and open-ended interviews as research instruments. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics using Statistical Package Social Science (SPSS) software (Version 20), and quantitative results were presented in the form of tables. Analysis for variant ANOVA and multiple regression analysis were used to test the hypothesis. This research discovered that strategic alliance types of relationships with strategic suppliers and transactional relationships with suppliers of routine materials have a great role in achieving economic sustainability of private telecommunication companies in Zimbabwe; hence, this research recommends private telecommunication companies to partner with suppliers who supply strategic items and take advantage of transactional kind of relationships especially with those suppliers who supply routine items in order to take advantage of best available price in the market. Future research works are recommended to include the following: Would the recommendations for these kinds of relationships reduce corruptions dramatically or eliminate them?. This is because the current “Zimbabwe is open for business mantra” and telecommunication companies are promoting transparency in all activities which include procurement as part of their efforts to fight against corruption. Moreover, further research should be undertaken to find out why collaborative types of relationships such as closer–tactical and single sourced do not have a statistically significant role in achieving economic sustainability in the private telecommunication sector in Zimbabwe, despite the fact that previous literature is suggesting otherwise. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

This is necessitated by the call for automating the construction process. Getting valuable insights from data has taken the centre-stage of digitalization in the business world, through big data applications. Big data describes the application of advanced technologies to mine insights from datasets to solve problems. Studies have recommended the benefits of big data in the construction industry, though scanty, but cognizance is not given to what it takes for the industry to realize to the fullest, the benefits of big data. This study identified big data capabilities across different disciplines required in the construction industry through a systematic literature review. Four major big data capabilities thus organizational strategy, data, technology and people were identified from literature through qualitative synthesis. The research was limited to peer reviewed articles indexed in Web of Science and Scopus. The findings together with antecedents of innovation from the Schumpeter's theory of innovation led to conceptualization of a process framework for big data capabilities in the construction industry. The framework consists of antecedents to innovation, big data capabilities and outcomes. The study addressed the gap of big data capabilities deficit in the construction industry. Practically, the framework can serve as a guide for construction organizations interested in adopting big data in their operations. © Proceeding of the 34th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2018.","Big data; Capabilities; Construction; Innovation; Systematic literature review","Construction; Construction industry; Project management; Advanced technology; Big data applications; Capabilities; Construction organizations; Construction process; Integrated frameworks; Organizational strategy; Systematic literature review; Big data",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055652067

This activity is set in the region of south west Wales, UK, where comparatively low levels of Business Expenditure on R&D make the research output of Swansea University and local Health Boards particularly important to support knowledge-based enterprise. The research aim of the paper is to examine as to whether the initiatives' novel 'Open Access Open Innovation' philosophy represents a practical implementation of the non-linear Technology Transfer model proposed by Bradley et al. (2013). In this regard, the case explores novel components of the initiative including their 'zero-waste' approach whereby all opportunities are progressed along a pathway identified as most appropriate, using a proportionate investment of resources. Data drawn from the Pilot/Initiation period of the initiatives suggests that these principles are in action, with early insight having potential implication for further development, practice and wider policy. This includes recognition of the inherent complexities of such activity, and the need for further data to emerge in order to fully determine the impact of the approach. © 2018 Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE.

However, the diffusion of SE research results into practice is still rare. This is especially crucial, since structured SE methodologies are required to support businesses with the ongoing digitalization of their services. To help closing the gap between research and practice, we conducted 13 semi-structured interviews with experts from eight enterprises in Lower Saxony, Germany, that are involved in (technical) services. The results reveal several requirements and barriers, which hinder companies from implementing and using structured SE methodologies. The findings can be used to help researchers developing industry-friendly approaches and practitioners to set up their enterprises for future-oriented (smart) service engineering. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Empirical analysis; Practice; Science; Service engineering; SME","Empirical analysis; Interdisciplinary fields; Practice; Research results; Saxony , Germany; Science; Semi structured interviews; Service engineering; Data processing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053892543

Traditional approaches to standardizing business processes are based on manually created “de-jure” process models, which are distorted, error-prone, simplistic, and often deviating from process reality. Theoretically embedded in the organizational contingency theory as kernel theory, this paper employs a design science approach to design a process mining-enabled decision support system (DSS) which combines bottom-up process mining models with manually added top-down standardization information to recommend a suitable standard process specification from a repository. Extended process models of the as-is process are matched against a repository of best-practice standard process model using an attribute-based process similarity matching algorithm. Thus, the DSS aims to reduce the overall costs of process standardization, to optimize the degree of fit between the organization and the implemented processes, and to minimize the degree of organizational change required in standardization and ERP implementation projects.

During the last years, OA knowledge has continuously matured, comprising insights into performance outcomes, antecedents, and moderators. However, there is a lack of guidance on how to put OA into practice. Addressing this challenge, our research is geared toward the development of an organizational ambidexterity maturity model (OAMM) using a design science research approach. Our OAMM follows a prescriptive purpose of use, helping organizations select actionable practices. To develop our maturity model, we first reviewed the general OA literature to identify actionable practices. Second, we built on the six core elements of BPM, i.e., strategic alignment, governance, methods, information technology, people, and culture, to structure identified practices. Third, we used card sorting to assign practices to maturity levels. We evaluated our OAMM with respect to general design principles for maturity models. Our work lays the foundations for the structured development of OA capabilities and for future research in this area. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","BPM capabilities; Capability development; Card sorting; Exploitation; Exploration; Maturity model; Organizational ambidexterity","Enterprise resource management; Natural resources exploration; BPM capabilities; Capability development; Card-sorting; Exploitation; Maturity model; Organizational ambidexterity; Administrative data processing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053509284

In an investigation to unpack this, tourism businesses were surveyed within the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Clustering and a stratification method were used. Managers and employees were purposely identified, resulting to 452 questionnaires being completed. Data was analyzed through the Software Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The Stakeholder and Critical Realism theories were also applied. The results indicate a preference placed on front desk departments to deal with BSR. Consequently this has to an extent increased transparency, led to a donor approach and a lack of fairness, raising important questions on empowerment and sustainability.

There is a gap between the abundance of data and the needs of users. At the same time a particular user needs not only a relevant part of the available data but (s)he needs higher-level (inferred) data in order to use this data in support of decision-making. Analytics comes to bridge that gap, by means of tools. Those tools link what the user needs to what is available as data; generate higher-level (inferred) data based on the raw data; provide visualization that is useful especially to users that have limited knowledge in mathematics and data science. The abundance of definitions that concern analytics as well as the numerous terms and concepts confuse users. Often different concepts are inconsistent with regard to each other. Inspired by this problem, the current paper: provides a systematic analysis featuring analytics in general and business analytics, in particular, developing this also from the perspective of visualization-related needs. We propose a layered business analytics architecture named General Architectural Framework for Business Visual Analytics. The framework presents the main interrelationships between the elements for designing and modeling Business Visual Analytics. We propose a conceptual definition that combines the semantics of the multiple recurring and overlapping definitions of analytics, named Business Visual Analytics (BVA). This is a new conceptual viewpoint mainly focused on the innovative data visualization techniques, business analytics capabilities and achieving business goals and performance.

Throughout their existence, they have become major employers in the regions, bringing about innovations, progress and social responsibility. If they are to develop further, if they are to be competitive against non-family companies that are managed by professional management, the successors must also use newer, more advanced marketing and management tools. The issue of family business becomes a big challenge for Czech academic environment too. This is a very topical issue, but not yet studied, it may potentially bring new scientific knowledge in the field of marketing management for family businesses in Czech Republic. The survey period of marketing vitality was between 2016 and 2017. Literature review has been prepared by means of desk research. Its elaboration was based mainly on foreign monographic sources, scientific articles available in the Web of Science, Proquest, Scopus and other databases. The scientific method was primary quantitative research – a questionnaire survey – which aimed to compare the marketing vitality of family and non-family businesses, and also to compare the use of defined marketing tools by family and non-family businesses. The survey data on 264 enterprises were analyzed using descriptive statistics, graphically processed and evaluated through correlation analysis. The results of this paper confirm the hypothesis that family businesses as well as non-family small-sized businesses have their success based on the so-called “value marketing” (and in the opinion of the authors intuitively) on building long-term customer loyalty by constantly increasing the value offered. © 2018, Centre of Sociological Research.

Business process analysis is an important phase of the Business Process Management (BPM) lifecycle because it provides a critical examination of problems and potential improvements of business processes. However, few studies have been conducted to provide novel analysis techniques and methods to explore external and future opportunities, in addition to satisfying clients’ expectations, needs and experience. In this context, we used the Design Science Research approach to build the Ambidextrous Analysis of Business Process (A2BP) method, which enables process analysts to balance exploration and exploitation thinking. We defined the problem and the research questions through a systematic literature mapping. Then, we empirically evaluate the proposed method through an expert opinion survey and an observational case study to assess the usefulness and ease-of-use of the method. Overall, the participants of the empirical study evaluated the method positively and suggested feedbacks to refine it. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Business process analysis; Business process management; Design thinking; Organizational ambidexterity","Administrative data processing; Design; Enterprise resource management; Information use; Analysis techniques; Balance exploration; Business process analysis; Business process management; Design thinking; Design-science researches; Organizational ambidexterity; Research questions; Information systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048943664

However, traditional top-down approaches to business model visualization are human-centric, “de jure”, subjective, error-prone, and time-consuming. In contrast, bottom-up Business Model Mining collects and consolidates different sources of business model-related data and presents business models in predefined templates such as the Business Model Canvas. This paper employs a design science approach to develop a Business Model Mining Software to automatically mine business models bottom-up from enterprise resource planning systems. First, this paper discusses weaknesses of traditional top-down approaches to business model visualization and the potential by data-driven approaches. Second, this paper derives meta-requirements and design principles as theoretical foundations to conceptualize the business model mining software.

Organizational decision-makers frequently do not have clear perceptions of which processes are of prime and secondary importance. Further, research does not provide a satisfactory definition of process importance and quantifiable proxies. Thus, this paper derives dimensions of process importance including the number of process executions, involved process stakeholders, customer or supplier involvement, and value chain position from literature, and introduces measurable proxies from information systems for each dimension. The artifact “KeyPro” is developed to explore important processes bottom-up from log data in SAP-ERP systems with visualization in interactive dashboards. As process library, we retrieve 220 processes from 52 process experts across four real-world companies. 773 ERP transactions are matched to these processes to measure which processes constitute important processes along the importance dimensions. We implemented KeyPro in three real-world SAP-ERP systems and a focus group of process experts. An evaluation in two case studies reveals significant deviations between perceptions by decision-makers and the results suggested by KeyPro. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Business processes; Decision support systems; Design science; Enterprise resource planning systems; Process importance","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data visualization; Decision making; Decision support systems; Industrial economics; Information systems; Information use; Business Process; Decision makers; Design science; Enterprise resource planning systems; Process decisions; Process execution; SAP ERP systems; Supplier involvement; Enterprise resource planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048600096

This paper aims to identify a set of key issues currently facing digital communications and reviews their relevance for the strategic provision of infrastructure, particularly within the UK context. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology focusses on taking a horizon-scanning approach to obtaining current information from a range of authoritative decision makers across industry, government and academia. After structuring the issues identified, these areas are explored by a multi-disciplinary research team covering engineering, economics and computer science. Findings: Five key categories were identified including future demand; coverage and capacity; policy and regulation; economics and business models; and technology. The results are reported for both fixed and wireless networks. Shared issues affecting the wider digital ecosystem are also identified including Brexit, connecting remote areas and the degree to which the economics of infrastructure allows for building multiple overlapping infrastructures. The authors find that future demand uncertainty is one of the major issues affecting the digital communications sector driven by rigid willingness-to-pay, weak revenue and an increasing shift from fixed to wireless technologies. Policy must create the market conditions that encourage the entry of new competitors with innovative thinking and disruptive business models. Research limitations/implications: A limitation of the analysis is that it is quite UK-focussed; hence, further research could broaden this analysis to assessing issues at a continental or global scale. Originality/value: The value of this paper originates from the breadth of the expert elicitation exercise carried out to gather the initial set of issues, followed by the analysis of this data by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers. The results direct a future research agenda, as many issues are indicative of a lack of existing evidence to support effective decision-making. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digital communication systems; Policy; Telecommunication",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047958769

The aim of this paper is to integrate external data using an ontology to capture relevant information for efficient decision-making. In order to achieve this aim, we tackle the literature to incorporate cloud and ontology to retrieve external data such as social media and internal data such as organizational data. The results can lead to some new evaluation methods in big data era from different perspectives.

It focused on apparel small businesses and pertinent stakeholder groups, at the Cigondewah center, in Bandung. Research participants were selected based on the essential role they play in organizational capability development. Data collection involved interactive interviews, participatory observations and the examination of related documents. After separating endogenous capability-development indicators from exogenous influences, the results show that apparel small businesses at the Cigondewah center do not develop the professional business skills necessary for their survival and prosperity.

The purpose of this paper is twofold. The first is to understand the institutional context in which this research is being produced, and to reflect on how it can be improved. The second is to map out key research strands in this literature, to discuss its achievements and limitations, and identify opportunities for future research. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative-qualitative systematic review was performed using a standard bibliometric approach. A total of 148 articles from 36 journals, indexed in the ISI Thompson Reuters Social Science Citation Index, were selected and analyzed. A systematic analysis was performed, based on a review protocol, which comprised following eight steps: research objectives, article search, articles selection, article identification, root themes coding, data coding, data coding validation and content analysis. Findings: Research about CSR Latin America features a very low citation record. It is also very fragmented. Both of these characteristics reflect little conversation amongst scholars publishing on this topic in indexed venues. More generally, participation in these venues reflects the location of scholars working on this topic as peripheral actors in scholarly conversations. The study identifies many opportunities for future research that attend to key issues that are relevant for Latin America and that will stimulate a more dynamic conversation among scholars interested in the region. Research limitations/implications: First, this study is limited to articles on CSR research on LA published in ISI journals. It does not show the whole trend of other academic and managerial publications in the region. Second, although the articles selected were retrieved based on 17 search terms derived from the theoretical framework, the complexity of CSR-related themes and its evolution could have caused some terms, and therefore publications, to be left out. Practical implications: Results provide scholars interested in the region with updated information about the state of research on the topic and about opportunities for future research. They also provide business schools in the region with a valuable input for a comprehensive reflection on research policy. Social implications: In the 30th anniversary of Academia (Revista Latinoamericana de Administración), this study offers recommendations on how research on CRS in Latin America could be made more visible and relevant. Originality/value: This is the first bibliometric analysis of scholarly publications on CSR and related issues in Latin America. It is also unique in addressing institutional factors that may be conditioning intellectual production on the topic. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bibliometric analysis; Business ethics; Content analysis; CSR; Inclusive business; Latin America; Philanthropy; Sustainability; Systematic review",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047065935

Research Design & Methods: We apply the Prais-Winsten method for Panel Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE) on a data panel allowing for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation estimating a model of regional exports for a joint sample of Polish and Spanish NUTS-2 regions. Findings: We identify a number of factors which statistically significantly determine exports arising from Polish and Spanish regions. These factors are classified into the following main groups: factor conditions, FDI, infrastructure, market conditions, remoteness and geography, spatial agglomeration and technological knowledge base. Implications & Recommendations: By going beyond national trade statistics, we provide evidence which can be used at the regional level to increase participation of regions in the world economy. Political decisions which are taken at the regional level seem to matter. Contribution & Value Added: This paper combines scientific knowledge from several perspectives: international economics and international business, as well as regional science. We believe that an interdisciplinary approach is necessary to increase the knowledge which goes beyond nations, while not focusing on firms, as units of analysis. © 2018, Cracow University of Economics.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the results of studies that address the promotion of BPM and lean in the health sector. Design/methodology/approach: To conduct a survey of published studies using the BPM and lean approach in healthcare, a search was performed in the Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases in two steps. The first step consisted of the collection and analysis of data related to the BPM approach in the health sector, based on a survey of published articles on this topic. The second step consisted of the collection and analysis of data related to the use of lean in the same sector, based on the survey of systematic reviews published in major databases. Findings: The main results of the studies that address the promotion of BPM and lean in the health sector are as follows: a reduced length of hospitalization, increased patient satisfaction, increased patient efficiency and safety, a reduction in the time of notification of infection, help with organizational change, understanding the end-to-end process, increased motivation, understanding the importance of some handoffs for patient safety, improvements in quality indicators in the emergency department, and improvements in the organization’s focus on high-level processes. By contrast, a single study showed difficulties in promoting management focused on processes in which decisions are unique and difficult to model. Originality/value: The results may help in the identification of research gaps in the promotion of BPM and lean healthcare and in the development of relevant research. In addition, by understanding how health organizations are promoting management focused on processes and the results obtained with this approach, managers from other organizations, especially in this sector, can reflect and develop similar actions that seek to improve the quality of services offered, increase productivity and customer satisfaction, and reduce costs, errors, and waiting times. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business process management; Lean; Lean healthcare; Process management",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044323642

Design\methodology\approach: Data were collected from a direct questionnaire involving 408 new ventures headquartered in Portuguese business incubators and science parks, of which 142 are located in rural areas. To analyse data, the authors performed a preliminary and exploratory statistical analysis. Findings: The authors demonstrate that only a small percentage of ventures operating in rural areas constitute examples of effective “rural entrepreneurship”, with the bulk of them being just enterprises located in rural settings. Rural new ventures tend to be small (in terms of employees and turnover), rely mainly on the internal market and lag behind other new ventures (located in both rural and urban municipalities) in terms of performance. Research limitations/implications: The study only includes new knowledge-intensive ventures, that is, those headquartered in business incubators and science parks. Therefore, it cannot be generalised to other new ventures located in rural settings. Originality/value: The extant literature on entrepreneurship has neglected the empirical implications of mixing, confounding and/or merging the concepts of “rural entrepreneurship” and “entrepreneurship activities in rural areas”. In this study, the authors discuss and analyse the empirical boundaries of such concepts and uncover the magnitude of pure “rural entrepreneurship”. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Municipalities; New ventures; Portugal; Rural entrepreneurship",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042911575

Some respondents had a class in entrepreneurship, while others did not have it. Findings - The results highlight that EE generally has a greater impact on business and social sciences students. Family background and gender are moderating variables with a positive influence on individual entrepreneurial orientation (IEO). Practical implications - This study's main practical implication is that evidence was found that universities need to develop more effective didactic approaches to EE. These must take into account new market demands and students' profile and always taking into account their different academic areas and levels of previous EE.

This paper uses spreadsheets as a metaphor to introduce process mining as an essential tool for data scientists and business analysts. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate that process mining can do with events what spreadsheets can do with numbers. Design/methodology/approach: The paper discusses the main concepts in both spreadsheets and process mining. Using a concrete data set as a running example, the different types of process mining are explained. Where spreadsheets work with numbers, process mining starts from event data with the aim to analyze processes. Findings: Differences and commonalities between spreadsheets and process mining are described. Unlike process mining tools like ProM, spreadsheets programs cannot be used to discover processes, check compliance, analyze bottlenecks, animate event data, and provide operational process support. Pointers to existing process mining tools and their functionality are given. Practical implications: Event logs and operational processes can be found everywhere and process mining techniques are not limited to specific application domains. Comparable to spreadsheet software widely used in finance, production, sales, education, and sports, process mining software can be used in a broad range of organizations. Originality/value: The paper provides an original view on process mining by relating it to the spreadsheets. The value of spreadsheet-like technology tailored toward the analysis of behavior rather than numbers is illustrated by the over 20 commercial process mining tools available today and the growing adoption in a variety of application domains. © 2018, Wil van der Aalst, RWTH.","Business process management (BPM); Data science; Process mining; Spreadsheets",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041814882

Design/methodology/approach: The approach in this paper is a systematic literature review of publications in the Web of Science, Ebsco and Pro-Quest electronic databases from 1990 (from the emergence of large-scale foreign chains in the Polish market) to 2016, as well as the results of research carried out by Polish and international research centers, food retailer groups and institutes. The paper is based on the analysis of secondary data that present the results of research carried out on the Polish food retailing market. These analyses included the development of food retailing formats operating in Poland. Findings: According to the research results analyzed, the evolution of retail formats is an embodiment of innovations introduced by retail companies and is based on the mutual permeation of elements previously associated with a specific retail format. Currently, the blurring of differences between individual retail formats can be observed in respect of two formats in particular, i.e. discount and delicatessen. The discount format occupies a special position on the Polish market, though it differs significantly from a “classical” discount. In discount stores so-called premium group products can be purchased, with stores more and more frequently being located in expensive places, e.g. in shopping centers or in their vicinity. At the same time, the popularity of convenience stores is increasing with a simultaneous decrease in the significance of large-format stores. Originality/value: This paper provides interesting insights into the development of food retailing formats in Poland and the influence of changes in the business environment in that process. In addition, the paper describes the specifics of the Polish market, detailing literature-based theories pertaining to the development of retailing forms.

Several indicators have been developed to monitor and compare productivity in manufacturing. However, in DCs most used indicators focus on technical aspects of infrastructure, not efficiency of operations. The purpose of this paper is to rely on operations management to define a commensurate and proportionate DC performance indicator: the energy-efficient utilization indicator (EEUI). EEUI makes objective and comparative assessment of efficiency possible independently of the operating environment and its constraints. Design/methodology/approach: The authors followed a design science approach, which follows the practitioner’s initial steps for finding solutions to business relevant problems prior to theory building. Therefore, this approach fits well with this research, as it is primarily motivated by business and management needs. EEUI combines both the amount of energy consumed by different components and their current energy efficiency (EE). It reaches its highest value when all server components are optimally loaded in EE sense. The authors tested EEUI by collecting data from three scientific DCs and performing controlled laboratory tests. Findings: The results indicate that the optimization of EEUI makes it possible to run computing resources more efficiently. This leads to a higher EE and throughput of the DC while reducing the carbon footprint associated to DC operations. Both energy-related costs and the total cost of ownership are consequently reduced, since the amount of both energy and hardware resources needed decrease, while improving DC sustainability. Practical implications: In comparison with current DC operations, the results imply that using the EEUI could help increase the EE of DCs. In order to optimize the proposed EEUIs, DC managers and operators should use resource management policies that increase the resource usage variation of the jobs being processed in the same computing resources (e.g. servers). Originality/value: The paper provides a novel approach to monitor the EE at which computing resources are used. The proposed indicator not only considers the utilization levels at which server components are used but also takes into account their EE and energy proportionality. © 2018, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Data centres; Energy efficiency; Energy proportionality; Energy-efficient computing; Operations management principles; Resource usage efficiency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038831501
