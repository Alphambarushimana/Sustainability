By 2011, a new character joined the discourse: the trapped figure. No longer would climatically vulnerable people be forced to move, they could also end up immobile. This review examines the narratives that surround the trapped figure. The article highlights the trapped figure's (i) characterisation, (ii) geography, and (iii) storytellers. The material includes the 2011 Foresight Report, 64 English peer-reviewed journal articles, and seven UNFCCC policy reports. The textual analysis furthers our understanding of the values that shape the meaning of the trapped figure within the wider discursive economy. Out of the 64 articles, 48 located the trapped figure in Asia, while 34 placed the figure in Africa. Meanwhile, the majority of articles—62 in total—were written by scholars based at European research institutes. The study shows that the trapped figure, much as the mythical climate refugee and migrant, is constructed as both a victim in need of rescuing and as an ambiguous security threat. It is ethically problematic that planned relocation was often put forward as an effective tool to “move” the figure out of harm's way. The review also found a range of binary opposites in the discourse on trapped populations, including those of order–disorder, freedom–unfreedom, and victim–savior. This suggests that however well-intentioned the liberal discourse on trapped populations appear, it remains embedded in power relations which demands for critical scrutiny.

The purpose of this paper is to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Overall 50 students from two universities in Spain and the United Kingdom, enrolled on two different degree courses (Global Studies and Marketing), cooperated in multidisciplinary teams to analyze real development policies and initiatives. The authors collected quantitative and qualitative data to assess the students' perceptions of the methodology. Findings: The students perceived the VE to be of great value, enriching their educational experience by having a positive effect on their overall learning and fostering internationalization. A high number of participants declared the teaching and learning methodology was useful to assist them in reaching crucial cognitive, skill-based and affective educational objectives, and to help them understand how development policy works while also raising awareness regarding real-world complexity. Practical implications: This methodology proved valuable in helping students acquire the set of skills expected from today's graduates in economics, political science and marketing. This active learning and pedagogical innovation component provides some interesting conclusions contributing toward widening the adoption of VEs in higher education contexts. Originality/value: The increasing complexity of the globalized world makes it challenging for higher education institutions to develop multidisciplinary approaches to education to foster sustainable development. The experience provided offered the students an online international experience at their home institutions. Consequently, the research elaborates on how VE can be applied in economics, business, management and political science courses to enrich learning experience by applying theory in a practical way. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Active learning; Awareness; Internationalization; Sustainability; Virtual exchange",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140267529

It has been associated to play vital roles in the human body like cardiac rhythms, immunological enhancement, and antioxidant activity. In plants, it is a pleiotropic molecule with multiple roles, as it not only performs extensive functions like delaying senescence, growth and development regulation, exerting antioxidant effects, and facilitating adaption of plants to certain biotic and abiotic stress responses but also provides resistance to chilling injury and disease development. This paper reviews the latest progress in the multiple roles of MT in fruits, summarizes the pathways for its biosynthesis, and presents the relation of MT with plant hormones, like auxin, cytokinin, ethylene, gibberellins, abscisic acid, jasmonic, and salicylic acid, and highlights the effect of postharvest application of MT on physiology and quality of fruits, action mechanisms, and safety regulations of MT. Recent trends focus on using alternatives that are safe for postharvest produce and do not have major side effects. MT is a better alternative to hazardous chemicals being commercially used in the postharvest management of fruits and providing future directions for its utilization. © 2022 The Authors.

Specifically, the papers highlight the need to critically research, understand and communicate effectively to key audiences before investing in sustainability or corporate social responsibility (CSR). Each of the papers represents one or more capabilities. The first capability represents achieving a relevant brand fit of values—whether via green environmentalism, via establishing corporate brand impressions, or through adopting types of CSR whose effectiveness might vary between luxury and mass-market brands. The second capability represents acquiring sensitivity to worldview beliefs or through careful framing of CSR that can impact differentially on commitment and brand attitudes. The third capability represents alignment of stakeholder values through collaboration. Finally, we suggest future research directions of sustainable brand practices, including studies into the internal capabilities of brands and how different groups of stakeholders might interact with brands. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Brand relevance; CSR; Sensitivity; Stakeholder collaboration; Sustainable brand practices; Value fit",,Editorial,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140266731

Thus, microalgae have great potential due to their energy content, high growth rate, short harvest cycle, and remarkable carbon dioxide (CO2) fixation capacity. However, using this microorganism on a large scale is expensive, especially in the cultivation stage. Thus, nanoparticles have been evaluated as a promising alternative to assist in the cultivation and harvesting of microalgae, offering solutions for different stages of the processes. Furthermore, nanomaterials contribute to the economic viability and processing efficiency of microalgae-based products that can be essential in mitigating or preventing adverse environmental impacts. In this context, this review addresses the contribution of microalgae biotechnology using nanostructures for biorefinery systems.

They can also trigger significant changes in structure, shape and governance models of supply chains. The goal of this research is to advance the understanding of supply chain intermediation and digital governance as coordinating mechanisms for enabling multi-level collective action to address the world's grand challenges. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual research paper that uses a vignette approach, where real examples are described to help question and expand theoretical insights and provide a basis for future research. The examples are drawn from past and ongoing extensive primary and secondary data collection efforts in diverse types of supply chains. Findings: Three contexts are proposed to illustrate how intermediaries and digital governance can play a key role in helping supply chains tackle grand challenges. The first and second context highlight the differences between material and support flow intermediaries in a triadic supply chain relationship. The third context illustrates intermediation within a multi-level network which can be industry-specific or span across industries. The three contexts are evaluated on the level of intervention, the focus on material or support flows, and traditional or digital governance. The specific Sustainable Development Goals which can be tackled through intermediary intervention are also indicated. Originality/value: Intermediaries are often hidden actors in global supply chains and have received limited attention in the academic literature. The conceptual foundation provided in this manuscript serves as the basis for future research opportunities. Three main avenues for further research in this domain are proposed: (1) novel forms of intermediation beyond economic and transactional arrangements; (2) novel forms of digital governance; and (3) translating multi-level collective action into sustainable development outcomes. Research on intermediation driven by sustainable development and digitalization trends can spur empirical advances in sustainable supply chain and operations management with important societal impact. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digital governance; Intermediaries; Sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140264608

This article investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on FREED patient presentations and service provision in England. Method: Data from three services spanning the pre- to post-pandemic period were included (January 2019–September 2021; n = 502 patients). Run charts were created to analyze changes in monthly baseline patient data (e.g., referral numbers, duration of an untreated ED, diagnostic mix, and average body mass index for patients with anorexia nervosa [AN]). Results: Significant increases in referral numbers were found from July 2020 onward, coinciding with the end of the first UK national lockdown. The percentage of AN presentations significantly increased after the onset of the first national lockdown (April 2020–December 2020). No other significant change patterns were identified. Discussion: There have been substantial increases in referral numbers and presentations of AN to FREED services whereas illness severity seems largely unchanged. Together, this suggests that increased referrals cannot be attributed to milder presentations being seen. Implications for the implementation, funding, and sustainability of the model are discussed. Public Significance: Our research suggests that early intervention eating disorder services across England faced significant increases in patient referrals and presentations of anorexia nervosa over the COVID-19 pandemic. This increase in referrals is not due to a rise in milder eating disorder cases, as baseline symptom severity remained stable across the pandemic. Investment in early intervention for eating disorders must therefore match increased referral trends. © 2022 The Authors.

This study, thus, aims to examine the sustainability of land-use transformation patterns from Sub-Saharan African cities' perspective. It also analyzes consequences of formal planning interventions and organic developments on open space ratio both in the inner city and the periphery. Hence, land-use mix and open space ratio are compared over time at both plot and neighborhood levels, which are both scholarly and practical. The research covers six cases from three morphological periods. Results indicate that the intensity of mixed-land use declined over time at plot levels, while the figure increased at neighborhood levels. Besides, moving from historic cores to peripheries reduces the intensity of mixed-land use at the neighborhood level. Across years, the intensity of mixed-land use showed a decreasing trend reflecting a reduction in the sustainable urban form. To avert this, cities need to integrate practices and principles of both organic development and formal planning endeavors. In addition, ensuring mixity and the existence of ample open space ratio helps to improve sustainability both at plot and neighborhood levels. © 2022 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","Land-use transformation; Open spaces; Sustainability; Town planning; Urban form","Sustainable development; Land-use transformation; Mixed land use; Neighbourhood; Open space; Organics; Space ratio; Spatio-temporal; Temporal transformations; Town planning; Urban form; Land use",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140258287

The scale up and sustainability of this model will require that student midwives are competent to provide continuity of carer at the point of qualification. Guidance relating to how to optimally prepare student midwives to work within continuity models is lacking. Aim: To explore perspectives and experiences of working within and learning from student placement within continuity models of care. Methods: An online mixed methods survey aimed at midwifery students and qualified midwives with experience of working within or providing education relating to continuity models. Quantitative results were analysed through descriptive statistics while free text responses were brought together in themes. Findings: Benefits and challenges to placement within continuity models were identified. These provide recommendations that will enhance learning from and skill development within continuity models of care. Conclusion: There is a need for continuity of mentorship and strong relationships between education and practice, and the provision of flexible curriculum content around this to enable students to prioritise appointments with women in their care. System level evaluation and support is needed to guide the optimal provision of continuity models, so that they are effective in improving outcomes and experiences. Foregrounding woman centred care as foundational to education and facilitating the critical deconstruction of dominant discourses that conflict with, and may prevent this form of practice, will promote the provision of care that is integral to these models. © 2022","Caseload midwifery; Continuity of carer; Curriculum development; Midwifery education; Mixed methods survey","adult; article; curriculum; curriculum development; education; female; human; human experiment; learning; mentor; midwife; midwifery education; midwifery student; outcome assessment; quantitative analysis; skill",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140255928

Therefore, this study aims to examine the effect of renewable energy consumption and green innovation on CO2 emission reduction in E7 countries within the framework of macroeconomic indicators, and whether they can contribute to achieving carbon neutrality targets. To achieve the purpose of the study, firstly, the fully modified OLS, dynamic OLS, classical cointegration regression, Bayer–Hanck cointegration, and ARDL bounds test are employed in this study. The existence of a long-term cointegration or long-term linkage is confirmed by empirical evidence. Secondly, the empirical outcomes of FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR reveal that a 1% increase in renewable energy consumption and financial innovation reduces the CO2 emissions by 0.357% (0.301%), 0.428% (0.336%), and 0.348% (0.306%), while a 1% rise in economic growth and inflation raises the CO2 emissions by 0.881% (0.015%), 0.946% (0.043%), and 0.875 (0.022%), respectively. Similarly, the results of ARDL demonstrate that renewable energy consumption and financial innovation contribute to the improvement of environmental quality, while economic growth and inflation exacerbate the deterioration of environmental quality. However, green innovation has no apparent impact on environmental sustainability. Finally, in the short term, the paths of renewable energy consumption and economic growth on environmental sustainability under macroeconomic conditions are almost identical to those in the long term, while green innovation significantly improves the environmental quality of economic development in E7 countries. To sum up, to achieve sustainable economic and environmental development in the context of carbon neutrality, policy makers in developing countries should fully consider the role of renewable energy and green innovation, and actively strive to promote green and low-carbon energy development, to make new contributions to global environmental governance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","E7 countries; Economic growth; Environmental sustainability; Green innovation; Renewable energy consumption",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140254899

However, many current methods employ silver salts as additives, leading to stoichiometric metal waste and thereby preventing the full potential of C−H activation to be exploited. Therefore, the development of silver-free protocols has recently received increasing attention. Mechanistically, silver can serve various roles in C−H activation and thus, avoiding the use of silver requires different approaches based on the role it serves in a given process. In this Review, we present the comparison of silver-based and silver-free methods.

Based on decision-making levels derived from the attitude-implementation-confirmation (A-I-C) framework and following rule conditions on front-and back-of-house processes, the aim of this study is to provide practical recommendations for the establishment of a pattern of green innovation action that influences the implementation of innovation among early adopters in the restaurant industry. Using 499 questionnaire responses and diverse statistical methods, we verify that the effect of innovation adoption is significant and positive on sustainable innovation, and the effects of innovation adoption and sustainability are both significant and positive on technology application and behavior, respectively. Moreover, the effects of technology application are significant and positive on behavior and mediate the link between innovation adoption and behavior. Finally, technology application is modestly moderated by green resource motivation techniques (GrRMT) to influence behavior.

The effects of these cationic polymers on the formation of bacterial nanotubes between Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) or Vibrio fischeri (V. fischeri), followed by intraspecies and interspecies exchange of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were investigated. The results showed that bacteria tend to produce more nanotubes accompanied by drug-resistance trade, which can even make the ARGs of pathogens spread to the environmental microbes of V. fischeri.

Based on four case studies of cluster organizations and a still novel abductive approach, we present the ways in which sustainability was executed in their functioning. Our study shows that the role of cluster organizations in formulating and reaching sustainability objectives varied with regard to their collaboration life cycle. The “Formation” stage laid the foundations for collaboration and relational governance, the “Growth” stage aimed at improving the economic performance of cluster members, while the “Extension” stage impacted more cluster stakeholders with regard to the economic, social and environmental sustainability objectives. Nevertheless, stakeholders’ self-interest induced collaboration, whereas relational governance was its essential feature. Moreover, the potential of cluster organizations’ governance structures was not fully exploited in the context of sustainability, their structures have played a role in raising awareness, but it was more the competitive factors that drove companies to engage in an activity because they wanted to stay in the market, change the conditions and keep up with trends.

N is a key yield-limiting nutrient in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench), as in most crops, so improving its N internal efficiency (NIE, yield to N uptake ratio) could increase productivity and sustainability. Understanding changes in N efficiency across time linked to carbon (C) economy can provide insights for future breeding targets. This study aims to characterize N and C dynamics (via studying changes in water-soluble carbohydrates, WSC) of 20 commercial U.S. sorghum hybrids released from 1963 to 2017. Field trials were conducted during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons in Riley County, KS. Seasonal changes in biomass accumulation, N uptake, and WSC were characterized during both vegetative and reproductive periods. Modern hybrids had greater NIE compared with those from the 1960s. Overall, beyond the yield gain documented for modern sorghum hybrids, the NIE increased at the expense of a reduction in grain N and, in minor proportion, due to increase in the N harvest index (NHI) at maturity for newer relative to older hybrids. Newer hybrids evidenced greater N remobilization from the stover to the grains during the reproductive period. This study demonstrates the physiological mechanisms for an increase in N and C utilization behind yield genetic gain for sorghum hybrids. Future yield gain in sorghum could be pursued by enhancing N uptake to sustain further genetic progress. © 2022 The Authors.

However, few information is available on the environmental sustainability and impacts for manure recycling systems based on different composting methods. The resource-environmental impact and eco-economic sustainability of two manure bedding regeneration systems: forced-ventilation static-stack aerobic fermentation (FVSSAF) system (Scenario A) and bedding recovery unit (BRU) system (Scenario B) were evaluated in this study. The life cycle assessment yielded a combined environmental impact potential of 0.01032 for scenario B, much lower than the 0.02656 for scenario A. The emergy evaluation showed that scenario B can handle more dairy manure than scenario A due to 57% increase of emergy input. Form the emergy indices of the two systems, scenario B had lighter environmental pressure and higher sustainability. Therefore, the BRU system had economic advantages and ecological sustainability, which was more suitable for large dairy farms. The trade-offs between environmental consequences, resource efficiency, and economic benefits were analyzed from several perspectives in this study, which would help stakeholders to have a new understanding when choosing a bedding recycling system. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bedding recovery unit system (BRU); Composting; Eco-economic sustainability; Forced ventilation static stack aerobic fermentation system (FVSSAF); Manure recycling",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140235871

Verdc; BGN) is an important legume grown mainly by small scale subsistence farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, in parts of Thailand and Indonesia. It has a high concentration of seed carbohydrate (55-70 %), protein (17-25 %), fat (1.4-12 %) and dietary fibre (5.2-6.4 %). A range of biotic and abiotic stresses together with socio-economic constraints affect its productivity, yield and quality. The changing climate and a growing world population are putting pressure on food production, as world food supply is heavily reliant on few crops. As such, there is need to broaden crop usage and increase yield of minor crops such as BGN. Improvements in production can potentially be achieved by a combination of advanced phenotyping, genotyping, environmental characterisation and overall management approaches. Breeding for advanced lines is complicated by overreliance on landraces. This review aims to provide the current status of BGN production, production constraints and approaches to overcome these, as well as its grain composition and nutritional value. It further discusses and elaborates on potentially available opportunities for overall improvement, so that BGN, like all neglected crops, can play a valuable role in world food security. Efforts should be intensified to improve the overall utilisation of BGN and its constituents to make it an economically viable crop. © 2022 Cambridge University Press.

However, empirical findings that fully describe the mixed-use concept in relation to its morphological implementation in planning practices are lacking. The present research acknowledges the importance of understanding the morphological context in mixed-use development, and it provides a methodology for assessing various patterns of mixed-use in relation to the urban form characteristics. This research employed factor and cluster analysis to understand mixed land use spatial patterns, as well as developed a typology of mixed-use spatial patterns for 105 block groups in Kansas City, Missouri.

The parameters of the system of output supply functions are estimated using Zellner's seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) technique. The likelihood ratio test in relation to the structure of the multi-output production technology rejects the null-hypothesis of input-output separability and non-jointness in inputs. These results suggest that the underlying production technology is non-separable between the outputs and the quasi-fixed input, and the harvesting level of one species is likely to have spill-over economic effects on the harvesting levels of others. The own-price elasticities of output supply are found to be positive, inelastic, and statistically significant in four out of five cases suggesting that, other things being equal, fishers' supply decisions are influenced by the prevailing market prices of outputs. The estimated values of the cross-price elasticity of supply are negative, inelastic and statistically significant at the 5% level for eight output pairs. The calculated values of the Morishima elasticity of substitution (MES) indicate the presence of substitutability between ten output pairs. The cross-price elasticity estimates are in the range of −0.001 (between Emperor and Catfish) to −0.275 (between Seabream and Grouper) which is lower (in absolute value) than that of the MES estimates. The magnitudes of the cross-price elasticity and the MES estimates indicate the extent of spill-over effects of one species on the other and signal the extent of species targeting by fishers. A statistically significant spatial, seasonal, and inter-annual variability is observed in all species cases. Finally, the implications of the findings are discussed from the perspective of developing effective management approaches, achieving sustainability of fisheries resources and improving fishers' socio-economic conditions stipulated in the Five-Year development plans for the sector. © 2022 Shanghai Ocean University.","Multi-product technology; Non-jointness; Oman; Separability; Small-scale fisheries; Supply responses; Targeting",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140232414

Indeed, the direct single-step synthesis of complex alkaloid frameworks remains an unresolved problem at the heart of organic chemistry in spite of the tremendous progress of the discipline. Herein, we present a broad strategy in which dynamically assembled ternary complexes are converted into valuable azabicyclic scaffolds based on the concept of inverse hydride shuttle catalysis. The ternary complexes are readily constructed in situ from three simple precursors and enable a highly modular installation of various substitution patterns. Upon subjection to a unique dual-catalytic system, the transient intermediates undergo an unusual hydride shuttle process that is initiated by a hydride donation event. Furthermore, we show that, in combination with asymmetric organocatalysis, the product alkaloid frameworks are obtained in excellent optical purity.

Access to doula services designed to meet the needs of historically underserved and diverse communities can mitigate the negative effects of structural racism and health disparities in perinatal care. Unfortunately, continuous labor support by a companion of choice is not universally supported. This leaves individuals with limited resources unable to access services from a trained doula. Volunteer birth companion programs are one model for increasing access to continuous labor support by bringing the community into the hospital. This article describes a birth justice-focused volunteer birth companion program that evolved out of a multistakeholder collaboration between community birth workers, local reproductive justice organizations, and hospital-based providers, staff, and administrators in direct response to community needs. This program is unique in its collaborative development, grounding in core values, and design of a reproductive justice-focused curriculum that includes training in diversity, inclusion, and care for clients with a history of trauma or perinatal substance use. Key takeaways include recommendations to center client needs, consider sustainability, and embrace flexibility and change. Discussion includes recognition of the strengths and limitations of a volunteer-based model, including acknowledgment that volunteer birth work, while filling an important gap, necessitates the privilege of having sufficient time, economic freedom, and social support. Ensuring universal insurance coverage for doula services has the potential to increase access to continuous labor support, improve birth outcomes, and diversify the birth workforce. © 2022 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.","birth; birth companion; community; doula; health equity; insurance coverage; pregnancy; reproductive justice; volunteer",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140219031

The organisation's CSR policies definition, narrative framing and communication are fundamental, as they can affect its reputation. This article aims to highlight the climate change framing in the Secil Group sustainability report (SR) narrative. Design/methodology/approach: The framing theory is applied to analyse the international and sectoral climate change regulatory measures and the Secil Group SR. Document analysis is used to characterise Secil SR as a communication tool. Qualitative content analysis is used to highlight how Secil and the international and sectoral regulatory measures on climate change frame their narrative and compare each other. Findings: The international and sectoral regulatory measures on climate change and the Secil's SR broadly frame climate change, using ethical, efficiency and effectiveness, communication and relations and law and regulation framings. The Secil's Group SR also highlights the financial frame, exposing the challenge of reconciling economic with collective interests. There is room for researchers to explore the concepts of CSR, sustainability and environment, social and governance (ESG) through the lens of complementarity. Originality/value: This study shows that the Wehmeier and Raaz (2012) model, created to study transparency, can be applied to other communication studies. This paper explores a case study and, for this reason, is not generalisable.

Perennial grasses are a promising second-generation lignocellulosic bioenergy feedstock for BECCS expansion, but optimizing their sustainability, productivity, and climate mitigation potential requires an evaluation of how nitrogen (N) fertilizer strategies interact with greenhouse gas (GHG) and soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. Furthermore, crop and fertilizer choice can affect the soil microbiome which is critical to soil organic matter turnover, nutrient cycling, and sustaining crop productivity but these feedbacks are poorly understood due to the paucity of data from certain agroecosystems. Here, we examine the climate mitigation potential and soil microbiome response to establishing two functionally different perennial grasses, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum, C4) and tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum, C3), in a cool semi-arid agroecosystem under two fertilizer applications, a novel cyanobacterial biofertilizer (CBF) and urea. We find that in contrast to the C4 grass, the C3 grass achieved 98% greater productivity and had a higher N use efficiency when fertilized. For both crops, the CBF produced the same biomass enhancement as urea. Non-CO2 GHG fluxes across all treatments were low and we observed a 3-year net loss of SOC under the C4 crop and a net gain under the C3 crop at a 0–30 cm soil depth regardless of fertilization. Finally, we detected crop-specific changes in the soil microbiome, including an increased relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi under the C3, and potentially pathogenic fungi in the C4 grass. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential of CBF-fertilized C3 crops as a second-generation bioenergy feedstock in semi-arid regions as a part of a climate mitigation strategy. © 2022 The Authors.

Firstly, different experimental pull-out tests were conducted in the laboratory to determine the effect of various factors such as water-cement ratio, curing days, cement to sand ratio, fly ash content and bamboo treatment on bond strength development. Three failure patterns, namely bamboo failure, bond failure, and failure of mortar, were observed. Secondly, using a two-level full factorial design method, different statistical models were formulated. These models (M1-Untreated, M2-Both treated and untreated) were developed based on bamboo surface treatment. The effect of single factors and their interactions were quantified on bond strength development. The developed models were validated to predict bond strength based on different factors.

This research completes Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses, using a typical contemporary model home as a case study, to investigate the natural ventilation performance of two types of ventilation blocks, Arcadian and Innovent, available for use in residences in Trinidad and Tobago. Differences in terms of internal air velocity due to varying wind directions are compared for each type of ventilation block used which are primarily positioned in the upper portions of the walls. The Arcadian has been used since the 1960s, with the Innovent being a more recent addition to the Caribbean construction landscape. The air velocities varied across the elevation, and the wind direction was a critical factor in achieving maximum air speeds at indoor locations. The elevation-Averaged internal air flow velocities were similar for both ventilation blocks investigated, and the changes in wind direction showed no significant difference in the overall ventilation performance characteristics when comparing the two blocks. © 2022 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","Built Environment; Developing Countries; Numerical Modelling; Sustainability; UN SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities","Air; Air conditioning; Air quality; Carbon footprint; Computational fluid dynamics; Developing countries; Ventilation; Air velocities; Built environment; Natural ventilation; Numerical investigations; Residential building; Sustainable cities; Sustainable communities; UN SDG 11: sustainable city and community; Ventilation performance; Wind directions; Sustainable development",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140215172

So far, this process has been only feasible with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-based binders. To increase the sustainability of electrode processing and to decrease the undesired fluorine content of Li−S batteries, a renewable, biodegradable, and fluorine-free polypeptide was employed as a binder for solvent-free electrode manufacturing. The yielded sulfur/carbon dry-film cathodes were electrochemically evaluated under lean electrolyte conditions at coin and pouch cell level, using the state-of-the-art 1,2-dimethoxyethane/1,3-dioxolane electrolyte (DME/DOL) as well as the sparingly polysulfide-solvating electrolytes hexylmethylether (HME)/DOL and tetramethylene sulfone/1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl-2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether (TMS/TTE).

But green development needs to be gradual and coexist with ordinary products in the market. This paper aims to study the green and ordinary product pricing and green decision-making under chain-to-chain competition. Design/methodology/approach: This paper considers consumers' multiple preferences and takes two competitive supply chains with asymmetric channels as the research object. Through the construction of the game models involving different competitive situations, this paper studies the pricing, green decision-making and the supply chains' profits, and discusses the impact of consumer green preference, channel preference, green investment and competition on the decision-making and performance. Finally, this paper further studies the impact of the decision structure on the environmental and economic benefits of supply chains. Findings: The results show that consumer green preference has an incentive effect on the green supply chain and also provides an opportunity for the regular supply chain to increase revenue. Specifically, consumers' preference for green online channels improves the product greenness, but its impact on the green retailer and regular supply chain depends on the green investment cost. Moreover, competition not only fosters product sustainability, but also improves supply chain performance. This paper also points out that the decentralization of the regular supply chain is conducive to the environmental attributes of the green product, while the environment-friendly structure of the green supply chain is different under different conditions. In addition, the profit of a supply chain under centralized decision is not always higher than that under decentralized decision. Originality/value: The novelty of this paper is that it investigates the pricing of two heterogeneous alternative products and green decision-making for the green product under the competition between two supply chains with asymmetric channels, in which the green supply chain adopts dual channels and the regular supply chain adopts a single retail channel. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Asymmetric channel; Competition; Consumers' multiple preferences; Game; Green supply chain; Pricing","Competition; Costs; Decision making; Profitability; Sustainable development; Asymmetric channel; Competitive supply chains; Consumer' multiple preference; Decisions makings; Design/methodology/approach; Development needs; Game; Green products; Green supply chain; Product pricing; Supply chains",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140210276

The oleaginous red yeast Rhodotorula sp. has been studied as one powerful source for a plethora of high added-value biomolecules, such as carotenoids, lipids, and enzymes. Although known for over a century, the use of Rhodotorula sp. as resource for valuable products has not yet commercialized. Current interests for Rhodotorula sp. yeast have sparked from its high nutritional versatility and ability to convert agro-food residues into added-value biomolecules, two attractive characteristics for designing new biorefineries. In addition, as for other yeast-based bioprocesses, the overall process sustainability can be maximized by a proper integration with subsequent downstream processing stages, for example, by using eco-friendly solvents for the recovery of intracellular products from yeast biomass. This review intends to reflect on the current state of the art of microbial bioprocesses using Rhodotorula species.

Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that it has a negative impact on environmental quality. Based on this, in the current paper, the effect of energy use, trade openness, and financial development on the load capacity factor (LCF) is explored for Turkey between 1965 and 2018. In doing so, a series of quantile approaches such as quantile cointegration (QC), quantile-on-quantile regression (QQR), nonparametric causality-in-quantiles (NCQ), and quantile regression (QR) are used. The results generated from the QQR and also validated by the QR reveal that in the majority of the quantiles, primary energy use, trade openness, and financial development impact the LCF negatively. These results suggest that primary energy use, trade openness, and financial development damage environmental quality. Furthermore, the findings gathered from the quantile causality disclose that all primary energy use, trade openness, and financial development can forecast LCF in the majority of the quantiles. Based on the research outcomes, policies, which may aid to solve the damaging environmental effects of the primary energy use, trade openness, and financial sector development in Turkey are recommended. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Energy consumption; Financial development; LCF; Quantile approaches; Trade openness; Turkey",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140135435

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has recently been suggested as a technique for mitigating this impending disaster. Hence, this paper presents a systematic review of literature from various secondary sources, with inclusion and exclusion criteria adopted for data collection. The data used in the present study was sourced from various online research databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and other reliable academic sources. From the findings, it was observed that only a few studies have been carried out on the possible influence of CO2 leakage on vegetation and soil chemistry, while its effects on biodiversity and water chemistry have received far more attention. Also, since many CO2 storage projects are still in the development stages, there is a need to critically appraise the various environmental and safety issues that may be associated with them. From the African perspective, there has been a dearth of studies on the potential of CCS, and therefore information on its impact on the environment is completely lacking. Machine learning and numerical modeling, therefore, present a viable option for the identification of potential CO2 leaks, and thus provide baseline data for future monitoring programs. Furthermore, a detailed risk analysis of CO2 storage and leakage should be carried out to fully understand the ecological implications of CCS utilization to ensure environmental safety and sustainability. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CO2 leakage and Africa; Geologic formations; Groundwater; Soil chemistry",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140133765

A total of 198 truck drivers from the third-party logistics service provides participated in the study survey. An asymmetrical analytical approach through fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) examined the casual recipes of the factors effecting driver’s intention to adopt eco-driving behaviour. This research also applied symmetrical analysis by using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), to compare the analysis with the findings from fsQCA. Results revealed three models of factors that lead to an intention to adopt eco-driving behaviour. The findings have profound practical and theoretical implications for the growth of new theories in transportation and environmental sustainability. Highlights: • Symmetrical analysis revealed that both perceived knowledge and subjective norm had insignificant associations with attitude and intentions. • Whereas, asymmetrical analysis, compared to symmetrical analysis revealed that both subjective norm and attitude were found as the necessary component to achieve proposed outcome. • fsQCA yielded 76% of variance whereas symmetrical analysis by using PLS-SEM yielded 61.7% of proposed model’s explanatory capacity, validating the use of asymmetrical methods. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Driving behaviour; Emissions; Environmentally sustainable behaviour; Fuel consumption; Suitable road transport; Sustainable driving; Transportation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140133679

This mini-review aims to present the main aspects related to the current seaweed market, the extraction, composition, and properties of starch, as well as its prospects as a sustainable ingredient capable of generating income and health for the world's population. The green algae species Ulva has been suggested as a promising source for starch extraction; however extraction is a challenge mainly due to the difficulty in breaking down the cell walls and isolating the starch granules. The algal starch granule is small (1.7–7 µm), and another characteristic is the high amylose content, above 55%, which may indicate that it is a resistant starch or slow digestion. Seaweed starch still needs to be scaled its production, extraction, and application potential, as a main ingredient or as a co-product of gum processing, which already have a production chain, as they have great potential as nutraceutical or functional starch for food of low calorie, or for applications as a thickener in the food, cosmetics, and other industries. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","food industry; marine biorefinery; sustainability; Ulva sp; unconventional starch","Extraction; Granulation; Planning; Seaweed; Starch; 'current; Biorefineries; Food industries; Macro-algae; Marine biorefinery; New sources; Social concerns; Starch granules; Ulva sp; Unconventional starch; Sustainable development",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140133316

However, in stagnant situations, where individuals in a social–ecological system tend to resist transformation due to interests in the status quo, the emergence of collective agency faces numerous barriers. This research asks how to design and implement spaces and methodologies that help to address such barriers. We posit that these spaces and methodologies ought to facilitate processes to reframe shared perceptions of social–ecological situations through: (1) questioning dominant narratives about a situation, (2) building capacities to reframe the situation, and (3) enacting new compelling narratives that support the group’s transformative agency. Our research shows that building a strong bond among participants is key but requires reframing tools that are infrequently used in academically driven participatory research; in particular, tools for reflexivity together with creating safe-enough spaces where participants can be truly open. Reflexivity and openness are conditions for allowing deep transformations of meanings, fostering new collaborations and promoting agency towards novel pathways forward. Through convening diverse social actors—from local farmers, residents in irregular settlements, governmental and non-governmental organisations, to academics—our 2.5-year “Transformation Laboratory” (T-Lab) showed the effectiveness of experiencing reflexive reframing tools to transform both perceived situations, and the participants' agency (i.e., the meanings and values of their role, capacities, and interests) concerning the situation. Our results support the importance of reframing in building collective agency for transformations. Throughout the process, participants deconstructed their narratives, constructed new ones, and enacted them. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Collective agency; Narratives; Reframing; Social–ecological system; Transformations; Xochimilco",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140131834

Therefore, it is vital to ensure the sustainable growth and adequate management of forest resources. This study aims to examine the current challenges facing the forest industry, such as the depletion of forest resources, the increasing cost of wood processing products, and intensifying competition in the timber market (caused by the tropical wood supply). These challenges force the world’s leading forest countries to intensify forest cultivation, to consult forest industries in the Far East and to optimize the sustainable use of forest resources. It was found that current distribution of cutting practices threatens the forest ecosystem. The study suggests a scheme where 10–30% of forest area is clear-cut, 70–90% is selectively logged, and 20–35% is exposed to gradual felling. Factors, such as harvesting time, exhaust emissions, the loss of young trees, topsoil degradation, load on the soil surface, and the slope angle are essential for building mathematical models of forest sustainability. The intensity of wood transportation is also a critical factor influencing the above indicators. The study proposes a model for reorganizing regional wood harvesting companies to improve their profitability. The theoretical model is adapted to the Far Eastern context, but is suitable for use in other parts of the world. © 2022 The Author(s).

As human-oriented institutions, universities have also embraced the ‘sustainable development’ concept on the quality of their internal and external services. Two overarching questions are most important for university managers to strategically guide sustainable quality development in their institutions: Which strategies do university managers adapt to construct a “sustainable quality management” structure in their universities? and how are these adapted strategies related to different aspects/components of universities? In response, we employed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) protocol to analyse the existing studies in the related literature. During the systematic review, we followed five steps sequentially: i) defining the research question(s), ii) setting inclusion–exclusion criteria, iii) recording eligible studies, iv) quality overview of selected studies, and v) discussing prominent results. To integrate the results, we benefitted from five enablers in the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) model and the sub-sections given in the European University Association’s (EUA) institutional evaluation reports. The results revealed that the initial steps for university leadership to establish a ‘Sustainable Quality Management’ system are integrating a sustainable quality approach to the main strategy document, and then motivating their staff to participate in and enrich the reform-level cultural changes in their universities. This study also discusses the strategies adapted to sustain quality development in universities’ teaching, research, societal services, and internationalisation practices. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to EAIR - The European Higher Education Society.","Quality management in universities; Sustainability in higher education; Sustainable quality development; Sustainable quality management; Sustainable quality strategies",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140130139

In this study, highly sensitive Ti6Al4V ELI powder typically used for medical and aerospace applications is studied. Powder properties of new and reused powders after 10 build cycles subjected to variations such as morphology, particle size distribution (PSD), chemical composition and flowability were analysed. The flow rate using Carney flowmeter increased from 6.8 s to 12 s. Oxygen content slightly increased from 0.11% to 0.12%. The dimensional deviations are measured in six builds of eight samples spread through the build plate. The density of the cubes does not show relevant differences in density (from 99.6% to 99.9%), only the last batch exhibits slightly lower density than the previous builds.

The report’s findings play a crucial role in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact and the European Semester. As a result, sustainability gaps have a significant indirect influence on policy decisions. In this paper, we analyze two non-transparent properties of these indicators. First, the response of these indicators to changes in the interest rate-growth (r-g) differential is not readily predictable in terms of both strength and direction. Second, in our examples for low values of r-g (in a range of 0.5%), highly uncertain projections for distant periods after 2070 explain about 80% of the indicators’ values. To address these problems, we develop a new decomposition that takes into account the notion of premia (Reis 2021) and hence allows for a more transparent discussion of the sustainability of public debt. © 2022, The Author(s).","Fiscal sustainability; Interest rates; Public budget; Public debt",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140126635

Most construction projects, however, employ traditional construction methods and have yet to be able to adopt sustainable construction, which is economically feasible, socially responsible, and environmentally beneficial. To support sustainable construction, this study analyzes various factors that might drive sustainable practices in construction projects in Yemen. These drivers are discovered from the literature and validated by experts using grey Delphi. Forty-four drivers were approved across three dimensions: economic, social, and environmental. These drivers are assessed using grey AHP. The economic factor is determined to be the most crucial in the adoption of sustainable construction. Competitiveness, improved well-being, and improved indoor environmental quality are rated as the top economic, social, and environmental dimensions, respectively. Overall, competitiveness is acknowledged as the most important driver for the implementation of sustainable practices in Yemen’s construction projects. The study’s findings were discussed with the experts who were involved in the evaluation. The findings were agreed upon, and it was underlined that a proactive approach from both construction project participants and public authorities can increase the competitiveness of sustainable construction.

A salt-assisted three-dimensional (3D) printing strategy is developed to fabricate mechanically robust TENGs with hierarchical porous structures. The triboelectric contact between the surfaces and external triboelectric materials as well as that of the internal hierarchical pore’s wall contributes to the excellent electrical output performance. The resultant TENGs could be easily recycled into different forms by light-assisted fabrication to extend their lifetime. The main part of discarded TENGs shows facile degradation under benign conditions without negative influence on the environment, while the high-value conductive fillers can be readily recycled. Overall, this work presents a new paradigm for completely sustainable TENGs, which will inspire the development of sustainable electronic devices.

In this study, it is aimed to investigate economic value contribution of corrosion prevention, provided by galvanic cathodic protection method during the use life of marine structures, with consideration of sustainability. For a real wharf structure, cost of galvanic cathodic protection during the economic life of the structure and cost–benefit analysis of corrosion prevention are presented, and a method is proposed for understanding its economic contribution. Based on a real wharf structure’s design and corrosion protection calculations, and considering a use life of approximately 50 years, average loss of material due to corrosion is 0.16 mm/year, in absence of cathodic protection. Thus, for the wharf structure under investigation (two segments each 10 m × 45 m size supported by a total of 100 piles with diameter 100 cm and depth varying between 34–40 m), loss of material is estimated for each pile as 95 kg/year, totalling 475 tons for 100 piles in 50 years. This loss may lead to strengthening requirements for the structure. Comparing costs of strengthening with 91.1 tons of Al–Zn–In anode that would be spent for cathodic protection, economic gains can be estimated as 285,000 USD. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cathodic protection; corrosion protection; cost–benefit; durability; Galvanic anode; life-cycle cost; steel wharf; sustainability","Anodes; Corrosion prevention; Cost benefit analysis; Economic and social effects; Life cycle; Piles; Steel corrosion; Strengthening (metal); Sustainable development; Cost/benefit; Economic life; Economic values; Environmental and economic impacts; Galvanic anodes; Life-cycle cost; Life-cycle environmental impact; Protection methods; Steel wharf; Wharf structures; Cathodic protection",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140121067

In this context, this study investigates the impact of financial inclusion on CO2 emissions in Asia–Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries. Furthermore, we analyze the moderating role of technological innovation and economic globalization in the relationship between financial inclusion and CO2 emissions. Drawing on the data from 2004 to 2018, advanced econometric techniques robust to cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity are employed. The augmented mean group (AMG) outcome reveals that financial inclusion and renewable energy consumption significantly promote environmental sustainability by reducing CO2 emissions. On the other hand, economic growth and economic globalization damage environmental quality by increasing CO2 emissions. The findings further unfold that financial inclusion fosters environmental sustainability through the channel of technological innovation. Additionally, the interaction term effect of financial inclusion with economic globalization poses an unfavorable impact on environmental quality. Besides, Dumitrescu and Hurlin (D-H) non-causality test revealed the unidirectional casualty between financial inclusion, renewable energy, and CO2 emissions, while feedback hypothesis among economic globalization, technological innovation, economic growth, and CO2 emissions. In line with these crucial findings, this study recommends that the APEC countries should promote financial inclusion along with technological innovations and, at the same time, integrate economic globalization with the climate change policies to achieve sustainable development goals. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC); Climate change policy; CO2 emissions; Economic globalization; Financial inclusion; Technological innovation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140120230

Data collection was primarily through primary and secondary sources. The data collected were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The nearest neighbour analysis revealed a clustered pattern of 47 eateries distributed with an Rn value of 0.37, z-score (− 8.23), (P &lt; 0.05). This form of distribution was mainly around the city centre, also known as the central business district. The study further showed a significant inverse relationship between the frequency of patronage and the distance of customers from the eateries (R value of − 0.68 at P &lt; 0.05). This implies that the farther the distance of customers, the decrease the level of patronage of eateries. Furthermore, the study unravelled the major locational factors of eateries, such as security, high population density, and tourism attractions, representing a mean value of 0.8–1.0. The Chi-square (χ2) analysis showed (df = 2) = 125.23, (P &lt; 0.05), implying that patronage of eateries significantly depend on the time of the day.

However, local strategies for sustainable development require a holistic and systemic approach, enabling multiscale involvement dynamics from several stakeholders. Increasing knowledge about implementing a governance model supported by a multidisciplinary framework could contribute to accelerating the green transition of cities. Given the lack of information about the deployment of governance models in the Euro-Mediterranean region, a case study was conducted in a medium-sized city in this region: (1) to analyse the emergence of establishing knowledge-based governance models at the local level; (2) to demonstrate the importance of knowledge circulation between different dimensions/levels, including scientific, technical, political, citizens and communication; (3) to provide a practical example of a governance model that improves environmental integration by building bridges between academia, citizens and political decision-makers. As a result, the authors proposed a step-by-step approach based on the quintuple helix governance model. The empirical findings of the study demonstrated that this approach could be successfully implemented in cities and contribute to improving local policies, reinforcing the role of cities as accelerators of green community-led transformation through establishing multidisciplinary and participative processes. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Environmental integration; Governance; Helix model; Knowledge; Sustainability; Transformation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140115123

It analyzes the relationships between 10 dimensions of ESG pillars and BP indicators during the period 2016–2020. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines a sample of 105 Italian banks and develops three econometric models to verify the effect of ESG initiatives on BP indicators. The independent variables are the ESG dimensions collected from the Refinitiv database, whereas the explanatory variables are performance indicators measured through accounting and market variables. Findings: The findings show that ESG policies negatively affect operational and market performance in the banking sector, suggesting that Italian banks have not fully embraced strong sustainability procedures. However, the relationships between ESG dimensions are mixed if measured individually. The results show a significant positive impact of emission and waste reductions on financial and operating performance, but regarding social aspects, it is proved that better product responsibility decreases accounting performance. Research limitations/implications: This study offers an in-depth examination of ESG practices in relation to current and future performance. In particular, the findings provide practitioners and academics with an actual set of predictors in the ESG area to improve BP. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the only study that has investigated the impact of ESG issues on BP in Italy. Few prior studies have used all dimensions of ESG policies at a disaggregated level to investigate their effect on various performance indicators. © 2022, Elisa Menicuccia and Guido Paolucci.","Banking sector; Corporate governance; Environmental performance; ESG dimensions; Performance; Social responsibility",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140114269

The results demonstrate that (1) The overall sustainable development capacity of all countries is at the middle or lower level and that it has increased over time. (2) The sustainability of natural and socio-economic dimensions and their degree of change show obvious geographic differences and income differences. (3) The national development path divided by income is characterized by a decline in natural environment dimensions and an increase in socio-economic dimensions, which mainly reflects a traditional development path model that promotes social welfare at the expense of the natural environment.

The present study used panel quantile regression and Driscoll-Kraay fixed effect-OLS estimators to examine these associations. From model I, the outcome shows that economic performance, natural gas rent, coal rent, and fossil fuel impact CO2 emission positively. Moreover, oil rent, renewable energy, investment in energy, and the interaction between investment in energy and renewable energy also negatively and significantly impact CO2 emission.

Therefore, preparing of landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) with the sound methods is a preliminary task for the safe and sustainable land use planning and design. In this research, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was integrated with the pre-existing machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Radial Basis Functional Neural Network (RBF-net), Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree), Random Tree, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and M5tree to increase their efficiency and accuracy of prediction of landslide susceptibility in Kottiyam town of Kerala. For the advancement of the ongoing research, a total of 189 landslide locations were analysed and datasets were obtained. To prepare LSMs, 70% of the total datasets was utilized for training and the rest 30% was used for the validation purposes. In this research, methods like: ROC, Precision, Proportion Incorrectly Classify, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Taylor diagram were applied for the validation of the models. Based on the prior pieces of literature, a total of twelve landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) were chosen. However, none of them found to be possessing multi-collinearity. It is challenging to select features from a dataset through optimization. In this regards PSO is effective because, it is straightforward with efficient universal optimization techniques. The PSO algorithm has updated and optimized the weights of models, and as results, the efficiency of the used models in predicting landslide susceptibility has increased. Nearly, 13% of the study area is very highly susceptible to landslide. The area under the curve (AUC) value of the Random Tree-PSO integrated model is the highest, 86.38% for the training dataset and 88.05% for the validation dataset. According to the sensitivity analysis elevation is most sensitive factor (0.285) and curvature is very less sensitive factor (0.115). As a result, it can be concluded that, of all the models evaluated, it is the most suitable for predicting a landslide tragedy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Advanced machine learning algorithms; Area under curve; Frequency ratio; Kottiyam; Landslides susceptibility map",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140109083

The mixed-integer nonlinear optimization model includes an analytical building model that considers structural and safety constraints and incorporates regional building codes. Using multi-objective optimization concepts, Pareto-optimal designs are computed that represent the best trade-off designs from which a decision maker can choose when they take additional criteria into consideration. As a case study, we consider the design of a multi-room one-story masonry building in Nepal. We demonstrate how the framework can be employed to address a variety of questions, such as the optimal building design and material selection, the sensitivity of the decision to material prices, and the impact of regional safety regulation thresholds. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Building model; Earthquake resistant building; Mixed-integer nonlinear optimization; Multi-objective optimization; Post-disaster reconstruction; Sustainability","Architectural design; Costs; Decision making; Disasters; Environmental impact; Integer programming; Optimal systems; Pareto principle; Structural design; Sustainable development; Building design; Building model; Building reconstruction; Decision makers; Earthquake-resistant buildings; Mixed-integer nonlinear optimization; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimization framework; Post disasters; Post-disaster reconstruction; Economic and social effects",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140108861

The aim of the current study was to investigate the effectiveness of agri-mats on water erosion control using a laboratory rainfall simulator. Six agri-mat samples were subjected to a runoff and infiltration rate test for this study: three agri-mats were made with 100% dry sugarcane bagasse and the other three agri-mats were made with 10% dry algae +90% dry sugarcane bagasse. The 100% dry sugarcane bagasse agri-mat treatment had higher runoff rate of 16.8 millimeters per hour (mm.hr−1) compared to a mere 1.7 mm.hr−1 recorded under the BA agri-mat during the first 10 min. In addition, the 100% dry sugarcane bagasse agri-mats released magnesium at a rate of 105.7 mg.hr−1 (milligrams per hour) compared to 6.6 mg.hr−1 lost from the 10% dry algae +90% dry sugarcane bagasse agri-mat treatment. Results shows that when algae was used as an additional organic material during the fabrication process, agri-mat delayed runoff by absorbing more moisture than it loses. Algae has the capacity to increase water-holding capacity while improving nutrient status and electrical conductivity of the agri-mats, making them more beneficial not only as the runoff combating technology but as a soil conditioner. © 2022 The Author(s).

Previous studies, however, have primarily focussed on the views of those with genetic conditions or those undergoing genetic testing. The aim of this scoping review is to investigate the genomic naive public’s perceptions of clinical genomics and clinical genomic testing.

Results from the study show that coal mining contributes to environmental degradation in South Africa, while its interaction with institutional quality mitigates the severity of this negative impact. Furthermore, there is evidence that economic growth has a bidirectional causality with ecological footprint and coal mining, while institutional quality also Granger causes ecological footprint. To promote a sustainable environment, there is a need for the government and the institutions to form the foundation for the shift toward environmental sustainability, with particular attention paid to the development and implementation of greenhouse policy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Causality; Coal mining; Cointegration; Ecological footprint; Environmental sustainability; Institutional quality",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140100865

The optimum asphalt content of recycled asphalt mixture is first determined by the Marshall test in this paper. Second, Materials Studio software was used to simulate the interface effect between three different asphalts and aggregate, and the adhesion between asphalt and aggregate was characterised based on the interface energy. The mesoscopic structural characteristics of three asphalt mixtures were then analysed using digital image processing technology. Finally, through three macro experiments, the influence of old asphalt on the mechanical properties of recycled asphalt mixture was studied from a macro perspective. At the microscopic level, the results show that the presence of the old asphalt reduces the adhesion between the asphalt and the aggregate. At the mesoscopic level, the presence of old asphalt reduces the porosity of the asphalt mixture. At the macroscopic level, the addition of old asphalt improves the high temperature and water stability of recycled asphalt mixture while decreasing the low temperature crack resistance. The microscopic and mechanical properties of old asphalt on recycled asphalt mixture are explained on three levels, and new ideas for research on recycled asphalt mixtures are provided. ©, Engineers Australia.","Asphalt recycled pavement; image processing technology; micro-structure; molecular dynamics; void ratio","Adhesion; Aggregates; Asphalt mixtures; Asphalt pavements; Image processing; Interfaces (materials); Mixtures; Molecular dynamics; Recycling; Superconducting materials; Temperature; Asphalt pavement sustainability; Asphalt recycled pavement; Effect mechanism; Image processing technology; Micro-structures; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Pavement material; Recycled asphalt mixture; Recycled pavements; Voids ratio; Microstructure",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140098045

At present, boilers that operate on fossil fuels are still dominating the generation of hot water, steam, and hot air in the food industry. In light of sustainability goals and carbon taxes as well as international efforts to reduce the dependence on natural gas, new technologies are needed to lower the greenhouse gas emissions related to thermal processing of foods. This review discusses important technologies that could serve as a replacement for conventional fossil fuel boilers in the future. These technologies are based on electricity, geothermal energy (direct/indirect use), and electricity to hydrogen conversion and include fuel cells, microturbines, engines, electrical boilers, heat pumps, radiation, and use of geothermal energy. The majority of these technologies are already available for implementation at larger scales and emissions are generally lower compared to burning fossil fuels. At present, major obstacles, such as low fossil fuel prices, still exist that prevent the widespread adoption of more sustainable heating technologies. However, the direct transformation of electrical energy and utilization of geothermal energy for heating purposes seem promising and should be more frequently installed in the future, whereas the use of H2 obtained through electrolysis as a transportable source of energy may also serve as a source of thermal energy where it is useful to generate electricity and heat on the production site or where the availability of electricity is limited. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists®.","CO2; food manufacturing; food system; H2; infrared; microwave; power to H2; renewable energy; sustainable heating; sustainable processing","Boilers; Electric power generation; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Geothermal energy; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Thermal processing (foods); Food manufacturing; Food system; H2; Hot water; Power; Power to H2; Renewable energies; Sustainable heating; Sustainable processing; Water steam; Fossil fuels",Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140097435

However, the factors influencing China’s current economic emission nexus at the regional and provincial levels and the sustainability of the strong decoupling state remain unclear. We analyze the decoupling of emissions at the national and provincial levels of the Chinese economy from the perspective of historical patterns and current drivers from 1997 to 2019. Also, we developed three scenarios (i.e., pessimistic, median, and optimistic scenarios) to analyze the impact of decoupling relationship changes. We find that China’s national decoupling relationship has eased since 1997, but it has not yet reached the ideal state, with provinces mainly exhibiting weak decoupling. The EKC hypothesis is tested for the whole country and 30 provinces and finds that 15 provinces have two turning points, 13 provinces have one turning point, and the others have no turning point. Based on the scenario analysis, the total emissions in the pessimistic scenario (S1) without any improvement of decoupling would increase by 73.97% compared to the level of 2019. However, the total emissions in the optimistic scenario (S3), in which all provinces obtained strong decoupling, are almost half of the level of 2019. This is mainly from the reduction of emissions in the western less developed regions (e.g., Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang) and developed coastal regions (e.g., Jiangsu and Shandong). On the basis of the results of factor analysis, we put forward policy recommendations for expanding electrification, optimizing industrial structure, and promoting technological innovation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Decoupling analysis; Economic-emissions pattern; EKC; LMDI; Scenario analysis",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140097122

However, amorphous and hydrophobic lignin often have poor compatibility with semi-crystalline and hydrophilic PVA matrixes. Moreover, aggregation of the filler at high content could occur to impede the effectiveness of lignin as a reinforcing filler. To address these issues, modified organosolv lignin (OL24) with hydrophilicity was obtained from the graft copolymerization of organosolv lignin and acrylic acid monomers after 24 h of reaction and later used as a reinforcing filler at different ratios of 0%, 5%, 10%, 20% and 30% in PVA to achieve composite fibers with better compatibility between the filler and matrix, and enhanced sustainability. The influence of the graft-copolymerized hydrophilic lignin content on the structure and mechanical performance of gel-spun PVA composite fibers was fundamentally investigated. The results showed that 10% OL24/PVA fiber had outstanding mechanical properties with an average tenacity of 7.8 cN/dtex (tensile strength of 1.02 GPa), average specific modulus of 143.21 cN/dtex (Young’s modulus of 18.62 GPa) and toughness of 20.90 J/g. It was concluded that the higher orientation, larger crystal size and stronger hydrogen bonding in the composite fiber structure contributed to the good fiber mechanical performance. These results offer technical support for the mechanical performance optimization of lignin-reinforced polymeric high-performance fibers. © The Author(s) 2022.","gel-spun fibers; graft copolymerization; hydrophilic; Lignin; poly(vinyl alcohol); sustainability","Acrylic monomers; Cellulose; Copolymerization; Cost effectiveness; Crystal orientation; Crystallinity; Fiber bonding; Fibers; Fillers; Grafting (chemical); Hydrophilicity; Lignin; Polyvinyl alcohols; Spinning (fibers); Sustainable development; Tensile strength; Composite fibres; Gel-spun fibers; Graft copolymerization; Hydrophilics; Lignin contents; Mechanical performance; Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA); Poly(vinyl alcohol); Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA); Hydrogen bonds",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140096594

An over-reliance on their application to crops to control pests can disturb ecosystems. Therefore, the scientific community and policymakers must be aware of the commitment and active stance they need to take up to effectively elaborate on solutions toward mitigating environmental contamination over the coming few years. We, therefore, reviewed the academic literature on bioremediation from 2018 to 2021 (the latest year of complete publication) to provide a meta-analysis of microbial systems capable of dissipating pesticides from agricultural soils. Natural attenuation can control lindane; however, it is time-consuming and unconvincing to scale. By introducing a suite of microorganisms into the system for substrate-specific biodegradation, we can boost the bioprocess and ultimately level up its cost-effectiveness. Options of microorganisms for bioaugmentation include the fungus Trametes versicolor and the bacteria Pigmentiphaga spp. and Paenanthrobacter spp. Bioaugmentation and biostimulation are enablers of environmental reclamation in agroecosystems. However, those biocatalytic strategies can be costly while manifesting as degraders to ecological sustainability. For instance, allochthonous and recombinant microorganisms can reduce genetic diversity by promoting antagonistic relationships. In addition, some stimulant minerals can be more toxic and harmful to beneficial non-target organisms than the target pesticide. Prudence and safety are significant aspects of ensuring environmentally safer applications for pesticide-degrading approaches. Therefore, our analytical insights can provide knowledge to progress the field’s prominence in developing high-throughput microbiological removal of hazardous active compounds from agricultural soils. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Agroecosystems; Environmental depollution; Harmful compounds; Metabolic pathways",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140094502

However, present quality management frameworks have not been developed for temporary multi-actor contexts, such as construction, which is largely lacking industrialised processes. Still, construction logistics service providers provide service offerings to temporary settings and could thus benefit from a service quality perspective. Applying this perspective, this study supports the quality improvement of construction logistics services by using a service modularity approach to identify the services to prioritise for improvement. Building on interviews, concept mapping, and a service blueprint of a construction logistics setup, a priority matrix for improvements is developed. The first step in using this matrix is to operationalise the construction logistics setup in modules based on blueprinting. Second, the matrix evaluates the modules against nine empirically derived improvement enablers such as practices and forums for learning, and data measurements enabling the comparison and follow-up of construction logistics services. In conclusion, the priority matrix helps focus the improvements on modules with high likelihood of successful improvements. Improvements that can become sustained over time through the reuse of standardised modules in upcoming projects. © 2022 The Author(s).

Gravastar was originally recommended by Mazur and Mottola that can be studied as the appropriate alternative to black hole. According to the model, gravastar must be comprised of three regions. It is renowned fact that the gravastar couples the de-Sitter spacetime with the Schwarzschild geometry with the help of a shell that is comprised of stiff fluid. In our work, we use matching conditions formulated by Darmois-Israel. We will evaluate the stability of the gravastar model along with the demonstration of the stability with the help of graphs. Furthermore, the role of f(R, G) theory is also examined for the maintenance of the sustainability of our model. We are predetermined to derive a singularity-free solution for gravastar and to discuss some substantially feasible factors of our model by using the formalism of f(R, G) gravity. It is concluded that the shell thickness has significant importance in the formation of length, energy, and entropy of gravastar. © 2022, Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science.","Bose–Einstein condensation; Equation of state; Stability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140083226

CCF are a novel trend for sustainable high quality double skin façade solutions, characterized by a minimal maintenance demand. The air cavity is designed according to stringent air tightness requirements, provided with a small dry air flow that preserves the relative humidity, minimizing the risk for condensation and dust ingress. This extremely reduced permeability, with respect to typical double skin design, gives a scenario in conflict with the general prescriptions for the structural calculations of double skins under wind and climatic loading. This paper is the second of a series of three documents that aim to identify the structural shortcomings in the current codes and to propose efficient calculation methods and modifications to the current calculation strategies. This will overcome a critical design paradox in double skin and in particular CCF aim to reach the highest sustainability performance, by means of outstanding thermal and acoustic insulation efficiency and providing the cavity with a clean and dry environment, suitable for a significant upgrade of the façade life expectancy. On the other hand, an overly conservative calculation approach is generally against the optimization of the sustainability performance indices, determining an excessive use of materials and then impacting the overall life cycle cost under several perspectives. In particular, the objective of this second paper is to describe in a measurable way the permeability behavior of a CCF, defining statistical variability and nonlinearity effects measured during dedicated experimental testing. The permeability functions represent a fundamental input for the proposed assessment tool introduced by the first paper and it will be seen that an accurate quality control during the manufacturing can ensure the robustness of an optimized calculation approach, based on the load sharing mechanism between the skins. In the third paper it will be shown that the proposed tool, fed by the experimental permeability functions, appears adequate to predict the façade structural behavior under the superimposition of thermal loading, wind loading and dry air flow effects, when compared with measurements collected during outdoor testing on a façade specimen. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climatic loads; Double skin; Load sharing; Wind loads","Air; Facades; Life cycle; Mechanical permeability; Structural design; Sustainable development; Calculation approaches; Climatic load; Closed cavity; Double skin; Dry air flow; Load sharing; Permeability functions; Sustainability performance; Thermomechanical loading; Wind load; Thermal insulation",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140082987

Nevertheless, the direct and indirect roles of international law in inhibiting space weaponization are limited, and a legal lacuna still exists in the governance of conventional weapons in the Earth's orbit. Independent and more focused discussions on specific issues related to space security are recommended given that the disagreement on related issues has prevented real progress from being made during multilateral discussions addressing the space technologies that could be used in a hostile manner. The integration of some norms of responsible space activity into the new LTSOSA Guidelines discussed under the auspices of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space is also recommended, along with an ongoing strong political constraint on the deployment and testing of dedicated space weapons in outer space through the adoption of the United Nations General Assembly resolutions and international condemnation.

Thus, this study examines the antecedents to green purchases. An online survey provides quantitative input for a SmartPLS analysis. The study draws on the theory of consumption values to investigate how emotional and social values affect green purchasing decisions. The role of knowledge-seeking in developing these values is investigated and found to be significantly positive. The relationships between emotional value, social value, and green purchase behavior are found to be mediated by environmental concerns. This study contributes to the discussion around consumption values by showing that environmental concern has a stronger relationship with green purchases than emotional and social value. It is through the environmental concern that emotional and social values influence green purchases.

Against this background, governments around the world have created various specialized sustainability institutions—councils, committees, ombudspersons, among others—in order to promote these agendas and their implementation. However, sustainability institutions have remained undertheorized and their impact on policy-making is empirically unclear. In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework for sustainability institutions and systematically explore their potential impact on more sustainable policy-making. We define sustainability institutions as public, trans-departmental and permanent national bodies with an integrated understanding of sustainability that considers socio-ecological well-being, global contexts and a future-orientation. Drawing on literature on sustainability and long-term governance as well as on illustrative case examples, we propose conducive conditions and pathways through which sustainability institutions may influence policy-making. As conducive, we assume sustainability institutions' embodiment of sustainability governance principles as well as their authority, a strong legal basis, resources, and autonomy. Further, we outline how sustainability institutions can influence policy-making based on their roles in the public policy process. We conclude that the increasing prevalence of national sustainability institutions indicates an ongoing shift from the environmental state toward a more comprehensive sustainability state. However, sustainability institutions can only be one building block of the sustainability state out of many, and their potential to reorient political decision-making effectively toward the socio-ecological transformation hinges upon individual design features such as their mandate, resources and authority, as well as on the specific governance context. © 2022 German Institute of Development and Sustainability (iDOS) and The Authors.

On the other hand, their dependence on dwindling fossil fuel sources and their durability has raised concerns about their sustainability. Biobased plastics, which include biodegradable plastics, appear to be an appealing solution, yet their uptake has been slow. This paper specifically looks at the commercialization challenges for two bioplastics: polyethylene furanoate (PEF) and polyhydroxy alkanoate (PHA), that have been claimed by the industry as potentially disruptive. The superior barrier, mechanical and thermal properties of PEF present a suitable competition to polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The versatility and marine biodegradability of PHAs have attracted interest from several potential adopters. However, the high production costs of both pose a serious commercialization challenge when considering the established production, supply chain and recycling infrastructure for fossil-based plastics. This study illustrates how firms are mitigating technical and market uncertainties by strategies such as adding value to other products, utilizing existing industrial assets, balancing exploration of more efficient and sustainable production pathways with commercial exploitation, lowering transaction costs by utilizing existing knowledge base, by developing formulation capabilities and forward integrating into end consumer products, or by entering collaborative alliances. These strategies could inevitably overcome inertia posed by the current market structure for fossil-based plastics. © 2022 The Authors.

While ecosystem-based adaptation practices are increasingly recognized and adopted across the world as an important urban development strategy, their effective implementation in diverse biophysical conditions and development contexts is of interest, requiring scientific research and learning. This paper presents the case of China in implementing an ecosystem-based approach–sponge city development–to address the water-related challenges of urbanization and climate change. It draws on the literature to synthesize understanding of the interaction between the urban landscape, urban development, and ecosystem services, and proposes mainstreaming an ecosystem service framework in spatial planning and performance evaluation to guide ecosystem-based adaption practices. Focusing on China’s practice, the paper develops a five-step procedure for operationalizing and mainstreaming ecosystem services so as to improve policy implementation for sponge city development. This paper aims to provide a practical perspective to help enhance ecosystem-based adaptation in urban development to better address the challenges of urbanization and climate change. Key policy insights Cities are increasingly looking into ecosystem-based adaptation, as an integrated part of urban development, to increase resilience to climate change and to promote urban sustainability. China’s experience with implementing a national initiative called sponge city development contributes to learning and an understanding of ecosystem-based adaptation practices to address urbanization and climate change challenges. Existing literature shows the need and potential for an ecosystem service framework to guide spatial planning and performance evaluation for ecosystem-based adaptation. China is in a unique position to mainstream an ecosystem service framework in sponge city development to improve current practice and to promote climate-resilient and ecosystem-integrated urban development. A five-step empirical procedure outlines a systematic approach for mainstreaming ecosystem services, contributing to the literature and policy practice to build urban resilience and sustainability in the face of urbanization and climate change. © 2022 The Author(s).

In line with extant studies, the study found that public debts in SSA are weakly sustainable and there is a highly procyclical fiscal policy bias in SSA countries, particularly in resource-rich countries, indicating that governments' fiscal policy responses are expansionary during economic upturns and contractionary during recessions, which may aggravate recessions and worsen debt situations across SSA. For robustness, the study compares the results with emerging and developed economies.

The growing interest in tourism offers with low environmental impact, which support the local economy, translates into a competitive advantage for low-density territories. On the basis of this principle, the scope of the present study is intended to evaluate the potential of the existing natural and rural features in the Beira Baixa region, located in the central interior of Portugal, which can anchor the creation of sustainable tourism products. Despite the undeniable interest in carrying out studies to determine an aggregate suitability index for the development of ecotourism using spatial multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), there are still no studies carried out in Portugal. The identification of areas suitable for the development of ecotourism, and their constraints, was carried out on the basis of the integration of nine criteria using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in a geographical information system (GIS) environment. The results obtained reveal that the region has high suitability for the practice of ecotourism activities, given its important natural heritage. This study was innovative as it shows the ecotourism potential based on a diversity of criteria as an aid to public administration agents with functions in planning, territorial management and management of support mechanisms for the tourist sector. The use of the landscape diversity criteria, which had not yet been tested in previous studies, proved to be important in determining the ecotourism potential of the region, together with the landscape value based in the importance of the Montado agrosystem, which supports a variety of sustainable tourist activities. The information produced in the study may be useful for the design of new policies for valuing natural resources through tourism. © 2022 The Authors.

Despite the cultural and economic importance of Arctic char in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR), limited data exist on the extent and presence of morphological diversity in this region. This is of concern for management given climate change impacts on regional fish populations. The authors investigated morphological diversity in anadromous Arctic char sampled during their summer marine migration-residency period when seasonal harvesting occurs in a coastal mixed-stock fishery. Geometric morphometric analysis was conducted using digital photographs of live Arctic char (n = 103) of which a sub-set was subsequently implanted with acoustic transmitters (n = 90) and released, and their overwintering lakes determined using active acoustic telemetry surveys. Twenty-three morphological landmarks were established and overlaid on digital images, and nine linear measurements of the body and head were recorded. Principle component analysis and K-means clustering based on linear measurements categorised fish into three morphotypes: slender body and slim head (n = 31), small and short head with a small mouth (n = 46) and elongated head shape with large mouth (n = 26). Tagged individuals of the three morphotypes occupied all lakes with no distinction observed. The three Arctic char morphotypes detected in this coastal mixed-stock fishery could represent adaptation to specific feeding–movement behaviours potentially tied to juvenile residency in freshwater systems, efficient exploitation of the marine prey pulse, or are relicts from ancestral types. To the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to identify distinct Arctic char morphotypes occurring in sympatry in the marine environment. Identifying phenotypic diversity will assist management to promote the sustainability of this regional fishery. © 2022 Fisheries Society of the British Isles.","Canadian Arctic; geometric morphometrics; marine coast; phenotypic variation; resource polymorphism; salmonid",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140057422

Water-related challenges have been increasing, with the number of cities suffering from lack of access to safe water and sanitation expected to soar, exacerbated by population increases and dwindling availability. While it is widely acknowledged that these challenges require systemic solutions to address them in a more integrated way, the concept, in current urban water literature, remains ambiguous. Here, we examine the potential of systems thinking in addressing urban water challenges and review the shortcomings of conventional paradigms and current management practices. System thinking allows for understanding of the web of interrelations that create these challenges and rethinking assumptions about how change happens. We highlight its potential to empower policymakers, water managers, urban planners and other stakeholders to address the root causes of urban water challenges, to shape and influence the broader enabling environment and conditions for the uptake of sustainable practices leading to the sustainability transformation of urban water systems. © 2022 The Author(s).

Accordingly, this study aims to develop a practical framework for evaluating the sustainability reporting performance of Islamic banks in the purview of the SDGs. This study employed the most recent Global Reporting Initiative and religious sustainability indicators to establish the measurement framework for evaluating sustainability reporting in relation to the SDGs. Centering on the Malaysian Islamic banks, this study found that overall performance on corporate sustainability reporting is quite low, though it has increased over time from 2011–2020. The bank-wise analysis implies that the SDGs reporting differs for Islamic banks, where most of the banks outperform on SDGs disclosure scores. Further, the SDG-wise analysis indicates that SDG-9, SDG-17, SDG-11, and SDG-1 appear to have the highest disclosure scores. Nevertheless, SDG-16 revealed the least SDG disclosure score, indicating that the sampled Islamic banks do not provide complete information about addressing sustainability-related issues. The outcome of the study might be useful to the regulators and managers of Islamic banks in embedding sustainability into their strategy for reporting on SDGs.

We demonstrate how the systems thinking approach in both interventions did not lose the focus of the chemistry content that needed to be covered, exposed students to the concept of systems thinking, started to develop some systems thinking skills, and made a case for the contribution that chemistry can and should make to meet the UN sustainable development goals. Through both the design and the implementation process, it has become clear that introducing systems thinking is complex and it remains a challenge to keep the complexity manageable to avoid cognitive overload. Both interventions leveraged the power of group work to help students deal with the complexity of the topics while also developing participatory competence required for sustainability. The development of systems thinking skills and a capacity to cope with complexity requires multiple opportunities. Infusing syllabus themes that relate to real chemical systems with a systems thinking perspective can provide such an opportunity without compromising chemistry teaching.

In this study, water quality parameters and pathogenic bacteria profiles were monitored for 1 year in rainbow trout farms operating in the same river basin. Then, a data set was created considering the pathogenic bacteria in the diseased fish and the water quality parameters in the farm environment. Each of the water quality parameters in the data set was first used as an attribute and their order of importance in terms of disease outbreak was determined. Then, using multinomial logistic regression (MLR) analysis, which is one of the machine learning (ML) techniques, the possibility of water quality parameters revealing a disease outbreak was evaluated.

More precisely, the corporate culture encourages information sharing and innovation among employees and connects them to increased corporation operations that may facilitate the acquisition of advanced manufacturing skills. The study demonstrated that corporate culture is critical to effective corporate integration and that information sharing and corporate innovation tend to be powerful determinants of green corporate social responsibility. Additionally, the study emphasized that these characteristics are the source of corporate social responsibility and adopting these characteristics will assist corporations in enhancing the green corporate social responsibility. © The Author(s) 2022.","Corporate culture; corporate innovation; green corporate social responsibility; information sharing; technological openness","Information dissemination; Sustainable development; 'current; Automobile sector; Corporate culture; Corporate innovation; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental sustainability; Green corporate social responsibility; Information sharing; Research gaps; Technological openness; Information analysis",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140044776

Franke College of Forestry and Conservation, Missoula, MT, United States","Rangelands of the United States provide ecosystem services that benefit society and rural economies. Native tree encroachment is often overlooked as a primary threat to rangelands due to the slow pace of tree cover expansion and the positive public perception of trees. Still, tree encroachment fragments these landscapes and reduces herbaceous production, thereby threatening habitat quality for grassland wildlife and the economic sustainability of animal agriculture. Recent innovations in satellite remote sensing permit the tracking of tree encroachment and the corresponding impact on herbaceous production. We analysed tree cover change and herbaceous production across the western United States from 1990 to 2019. We show that tree encroachment is widespread in US rangelands; absolute tree cover has increased by 50% (77,323 km2) over 30 years, with more than 25% (684,852 km2) of US rangeland area experiencing tree cover expansion. Since 1990, 302 ± 30 Tg of herbaceous biomass have been lost. Accounting for variability in livestock biomass utilization and forage value reveals that this lost production is valued at between $4.1–$5.6 billion US dollars. Synthesis and applications. The magnitude of impact of tree encroachment on rangeland loss is similar to conversion to cropland, another well-known and primary mechanism of rangeland loss in the US Prioritizing conservation efforts to prevent tree encroachment can bolster ecosystem and economic sustainability, particularly among privately-owned lands threatened by land-use conversion. © 2022 The Authors.

A numerical model was developed to examine retrogressive bank erosion across reservoir drawdown scenarios and to evaluate factors controlling the rate, volume, and mechanisms of lateral erosion. Modeled processes included dynamic drawdown of groundwater, sequential slope failures via limit equilibrium analysis, and retrogression considering stress interaction between failing blocks. Field measurements were coupled with Staged, Slow, and Rapid drawdown scenarios. Results highlight the importance of including retrogression as an avenue for lateral erosion, as sequential block failures were found to occur in all scenarios except Slow drawdown. This result indicates that bank stability models without some means of characterizing the evolution of slope failure during drawdown are likely underestimating bank failure rates and volumes. In contrast, dynamic groundwater was not found to be a dominant control for any drawdown scenario. Model results also demonstrate that the drawdown increment is a first-order control on slope instability via the development of drained or undrained conditions. A majority of failures occurred under undrained conditions. To maximize slope stability, using slow drawdown to activate internal friction under drained conditions is essential. The design of the drawdown rate created a tradeoff between the amount of impact created and when the impact is produced. The study also articulated the need for coupling models and field observations for rapidly changing systems. © 2022 American Water Resources Association.","computational methods; lateral erosion; reservoir drawdown; reservoir sedimentation; sediment transport; slope stability; sustainability","Erosion; Failure analysis; Groundwater; Reservoir management; Reservoirs (water); Sediment transport; Water levels; Ageing infrastructures; Bank erosion; Erosional process; Lateral erosion; Limit equilibrium analysis; Management strategies; Reservoir drawdowns; Reservoir sedimentation; Slope failure; Undrained conditions; Slope stability",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140043371

In-depth empirical investigations of local environmental stewardship are needed to understand how social-ecological context influences stewardship, as well as the arrangement of conceptual elements in applied settings. This study addresses these needs by conducting an in-depth exploration of environmental stewardship in the Niagara Region of Canada. A single embedded case study design is employed, with environmental stewardship initiatives constituting the individual units of analysis with the case. Analysis of the spatial arrangement of a total of 89 initiatives indicated that initiatives tended to cluster closer to the Niagara River and in more populous municipalities. The significance of collaboration, tensions between the environment and economic development, and concerns about political impacts emerged as themes across contextual factors. The configuration of stewardship elements reveals interesting discrepancies between initiatives and previous stewardship research focused on larger scales, individuals, and organizations.

In this region, Communities of practice (CoP) are cultivated to link various industry sectors together, sharing knowledge and creating a practical solution to circular economy related challenges. While current literature provides the framework of a regional innovation ecosystem in the form of Triple Helix, the role of CoP is underexplored. The key research question of this paper is ‘how can the CoP approach cultivate regional circular economy innovation?’ Through an in-depth case study of the Communities of Circular Economy Innovation (CEIC) project in East Wales, the paper identifies the construct of CoP, its dynamic lifecycle, and the interaction between CoP and Triple Helix. Findings reveal that whistle universities and government play a leading role in innovation at early stages by deliberately establishing the CoP, the self-governance of CoP at later stages results in active influence on industry changes and policy designs. The paper contributes to the literature on micro-relations among regional innovation actors by highlighting the role of CoP in creating emerging new knowledge and tools.

Across the social and environmental sustainability dimensions of IGG, however, the effects differ substantially. Notably, whilst the EG-governance pathways yield remarkable environmental sustainability net gains, a modest harmful effect was observed for socioeconomic sustainability. Evidence from our threshold analyses also suggests that whilst government effectiveness is critical for propelling EG to promote IGG, across the social and environmental perspectives of IGG, it is investments in building frameworks and structures for corruption control and the rule of law that are crucial.

Reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) is a sustainable alternative for construction aggregates. Several researchers have identified RAP as inferior material over natural coarse aggregates and proposed incorporating materials like superplasticizers, admixtures, fibers, and pozzolanic materials to compensate for the decrease in mechanical properties. Thus, the present study aims to evaluate the mechanical and durability characteristics of RAP-based roller-compacted concrete with red mud as part addition to cement. The present study considers a constant replacement percentage of 50% by weight of natural aggregates with RAP to evaluate mechanical and durability properties. Upon comparing the fresh properties of RAP-based roller-compacted concrete with red mud over roller-compacted concrete with only natural aggregates, a 3–15% increase in optimum moisture content is observed. Further, the mechanical properties like compressive, flexural, and tensile strengths, which showed a downtrend due to RAP inclusion, have significantly improved by incorporating red mud. However, a 15% red mud by cement weight is observed to be an optimum dosage based on the mechanical properties. Red mud-inclusive mixes outperformed RAP and control mixes in terms of durability characteristics such as water absorption, abrasion loss, and resistance to the aggressive environment. Further, incorporating 15% red mud in RAP-based roller-compacted concrete liberates a lower calcium silica ratio, which ascertains the dense microstructure formation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Chinese Society of Pavement Engineering.","Durability; Microstructure; Reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP); Red mud; Roller compacted concrete pavement (RCCP); Strength; Sustainability","Asphalt concrete; Asphalt pavements; Cements; Concrete aggregates; Concrete mixtures; Durability; Reclamation; Roller compacted concrete; Rollers (machine components); Silica; Sustainable development; Tensile strength; Water absorption; Natural aggregate; Reclaimed asphalt pavement; Reclaimed asphalt pavements; Red mud; Reuse; Roller compacted concrete pavement; Roller compacted concrete pavements; Roller compacted concretes; Strength; Sustainable use; Microstructure",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140013641

Through the case study of business school in France, it shows how sustainability integration is a longitudinal process, influenced by contextual factors which facilitate and impede the learning process. It aims to contribute to the literature of sustainability in higher education by bringing in insights from organizational learning theory. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses the case study method to analyze the sustainability integration over the specific period. To do so, data was compiled by analyzing internal documents, publicly available sustainability reports. Further data was also complimented by the interviews, which gave intra-organizational level insights. Findings: The case highlights that organizational learning for sustainability is stimulated by deans, faculty and institute of sustainability. It provides insights about how designing and implementing sustainability initiatives within an HEI is not a fixed goal; on the contrary, it is an ongoing learning process. However, this learning is also prone to barriers due to the ambiguous nature of sustainability. Research limitations/implications: This research was conducted within a specific time, geographical and cultural context; hence, its result may lack generalization. Further comparative research is encouraged to explore similarity and differences within different HEI settings. Practical implications: This research also gives potential insights for developing contextual awareness to prioritize, design and implement sustainability initiatives. Thus, it may be useful for the HEI administrators such as deans, sustainability managers and faculty members. Social implications: This case emphasizes that HEI like business schools need to expand their relevance via social responsibility.

Santa María del Oro crater lake lies in rural northwest Mexico and is of interest for global change studies and as a natural resource that sustains the economies of local communities. Temporal trends of trace element (As, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn) concentrations over the past century were assessed in four 210Pb-dated sediment cores, under the hypothesis that recent anthropogenic activities have promoted increasing trace element inputs. Data were analyzed within three periods: (1) pre-1900s, from which background levels were estimated, (2) pre-1950, and (3) post-1950. Trace element provenance was determined through a chemometric approach. Most trace element concentrations varied little in the past ~ 100 years, with no Co, V, and Zn enrichment, and minor enrichment by Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb in a few sections of the cores collected from the deepest locations, within the hypolimnion, and by Pb along the shallowest core. In contrast, As enrichment in the deep cores reached moderately severe levels during the post-1950 period. Cobalt, Pb, V, and Zn input to the lake was related to terrigenous sources. Lead enrichment was mainly anthropogenic (the shallow coring site is close to human settlements). Copper and Cr variability were mostly the result of diagenetic reactions. Arsenic enrichment, however, was attributed to biogeochemical cycling processes, likely exacerbated by drought conditions and enhanced calcite precipitation. Contradicting our hypothesis, recent anthropogenic impact on the lake´s environmental quality was small. However, a preliminary assessment, based on international guidelines, indicated that As, Cr, and Ni concentrations could be harmful to benthic biota, even at background levels. High As concentrations could affect the aquatic food web and human health, the latter through fish consumption. Given predictions for increasing droughts in the area, which induce greater evaporation and lower water levels, this issue could worsen in the future. Further studies on As contamination in the lake are needed to better understand potential hazards and enhance response capacity. Such data must be part of conservation efforts and should be integrated into management policies to ensure the lake's sustainability. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Arsenic contamination; Lacustrine sediments; Trace elements; Tropical crater lake",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140002890

These sectors play a large role in national emissions, biodiversity conservation, and human well-being. There are numerous possible pathways to sustainability in these sectors and potential synergies and trade-offs along those pathways. This paper reports on the use of a model for Canada’s land use to 2050 to assess three different pathways (one based on current trends and two with differing levels of ambition for meeting sustainability targets). This was done as part of a large international consortium, Food, Agriculture, Biodiversity, Land and Energy (FABLE), which allows for incorporating international trade in meeting both national and global sustainability targets. The results show not only the importance of increasingly stringent policies in meeting the targets, but also the role that population and consumption (e.g., diets) play in meeting the targets. Both the medium and high ambition sustainability pathways can drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions while protecting forestland. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Canada; Food systems; GHG emissions; Land-use changes; Scenario assessment; Sustainable development goals",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139999102

It is shown that a substitution of Pb2+ sites with Ln3+ ions leads to a blueshift of emission position induced by an increase of the bandgap of CsPbBr3. Additionally, the GIG-samples are revealed to feature excellent photoluminescent (PL) properties after being immersed respectively in water for 300 days at room temperature, boiling water for 12 h, and corrosive environments for 24 h, as well as recoverable PL intensity either after several cycles of heat-cooling experiments or after being continuously exposed to a 405 nm laser irradiation. Besides, a spontaneous enhancement of 20-25% of emission intensity during the 1-2.5 hours' stage of a 405 nm laser irradiation, attributed to the radiative recombination of charge carriers that can be de-trapped from trapping levels upon the laser light irradiation and that then spontaneously reinforces the emission intensity, is observed in the GIG-CsPbBr3:Ln3+ NCs. Finally, a white light-emitting prototype, with a CIE chromaticity coordinate at (0.4110, 0.3706), a color rendering index of 89 and a correlated color temperature of 3363 K is realized by combining the GIG-CsPbBr3 NCs, YAG:Ce and CaWO4:Eu phosphors. © 2022 The Authors.

The economic growth of BRI member countries can be improved significantly, attributable to the successfulness of the infrastructure projects. The increased economic growth indirectly leads to higher energy consumption and environmental damage. In response to this, the BRI established a new concept and version of the project, namely green BRI. Thus, this study aims to examine if green finance plays a significant role in mitigating environmental degradation in the BRI region. Utilising a Generalised Method of Moments approach, we find green finance is negatively and significantly correlated with environmental degradation, suggesting green finance play an essential role to reduce the deterioration of environmental quality, while enhancing economic growth at the same time. In conclusion, BRI member states should continue promoting green finance by implementing incentive schemes, such as subsidising interest rates for the green loan, reducing corporate tax and establishing green credit guarantee scheme. Besides, in order simultaneously enhance economic growth, promote sustainability and achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, both governments and private sector should work hand in hand to promote green transformation of BRI. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","BRI region; Environmental degradation; Green finance; SDG",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139995024

Methods: A literature review was performed to identify LCA’s digital technologies that can be implemented within the agri-food system. Furthermore, an in-depth interview with a panel of senior researchers was conducted to establish a set of items and assess the perceived benefits and barriers associated with an “empowered LCA”, i.e. a future-oriented LCA based on digital technologies. To this end, a two-stage exploratory factor analysis relying on the principal component analysis technique was carried out to refine the set of items. Finally, a covariance-based structural equation model was performed, built on a confirmatory factor analysis, to test the measurement model. Results and discussion: The study’s findings provide five constructs to explore the potential benefits and barriers related to adopting a digital technologies-based LCA (empowered LCA) for a circular economy transition in the agri-food system. More specifically, the benefits can be assessed using the following constructs: “benefits for the data collection and analysis”, “benefits for the LCA analysts”, “benefits for the management” and “benefits for traceability”. In addition, the barriers have been evaluated using a single construct labelled “general barriers”. Conclusions: The study highlights the relevance of digital technologies for a circular economy transition to develop a more reliable LCA, enhancing legislative compliance and supporting the traceability processes in the agri-food system. The associated implications for LCA experts, agri-food managers and policymakers are presented. Furthermore, limitations and future research directions are also discussed. © 2022, The Author(s).","Agri-food system; Circular economy; Digital technologies; Life cycle assessment; Sustainability","article; catalysis; confirmatory factor analysis; digital technology; economic aspect; empowerment; exploratory factor analysis; human; interview; life cycle assessment; manager; perception; principal component analysis; structural equation modeling",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139990138

This apocalyptic future of the Arctic relates to a set of narratives associated with the Anthropocene, wherein snowy landscapes, glaciers and polar bears have disappeared. This has led to a trend called last chance tourism, which has become an evolving economic opportunity for tourism operators and local communities. In this conceptual article we propose an alternative vision for Arctic tourism development referred to as “post-Arctic tourism”. In order to illustrate the idea, we utilize Finnish Lapland (Arctic Finland) as an example based on existing literature. It is argued that post-Arctic tourism may be based on so-called dark tourism practices if the used and circulated hegemonic representations of the Arctic remain locked in cryospheric- and traditional winter-based imaginaries. This scenario is supported by a social spatialization process called “Arctification”, associated with active attempts to maintain the cryospheric gaze. It is therefore critical for tourism businesses, regions and tourism-dependent communities to rethink and re-invent their Arctic narratives, through “de-Arctification” strategies, allowing for a plurality of tomorrows and for Arctic tourism to become more sustainable and ethical. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Anthropocene; De-Arctification; Finnish Lapland; Post-Arctic tourism; Sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139982245

According to the majority of business administrators and accounting scholars, the reporting tool that currently fulfils the aforementioned purposes lies in implementing the so-called integrated report (<IR>). In this view, this research aims at understanding if and how the Italian airport operators are approaching the drafting of an <IR>. The airport operators' sector is particularly significant because of the relevant social and environmental impact it exerts on the external context. For this reason, it is important to understand how they try to satisfy the stakeholders' requests. Thus, following the format already tested in other similar investigations, this study carries out an analysis of social or sustainability reports published by these companies to determine which of the key elements of the first internationally recognized <IR> are already included in such reports. The findings show that reporting scores range from 40 to 70%. As expected, the current reporting lacks the key connections required from the <IR> and shows a little looking-forward orientation.

The problem is also explained by the lack of research that has investigated the relationship between the best governance structure that contributes to achieving sustainability goals, including climate actions (SDG13) and clean energy adoption (SDG7) as part of the 2030 Agenda. Design/methodology/approach: The level of disclosure is measured on the basis of the carbon disclosure score calculated by the carbon disclosure project (CDP). The study sample consists of 387 US companies that voluntarily participated in the CDP survey from 2011 to 2018. The authors use panel data analysis based on multiple regression models. Findings: The results confirm the influential role of board size, director independence, the presence of women on the board and the presence of an environmental committee on carbon disclosure. In terms of carbon disclosure, the results suggest that a better governance structure is likely to reduce carbon emissions and improve carbon performance practices. Similarly, the analyses show a different representation of the role of corporate governance in high-carbon sectors compared to low-carbon sectors. Research limitations/implications: This study has some limitations. First, the sample is only interested in US companies that responded to the CDP questionnaire during the period 2011–2018. Thus, the results cannot be generalized to countries with different governance structures. Second, the data from this study on carbon disclosure, specifically focuses on CDP reporting to determine the carbon disclosure score. In this sense, the findings on information disclosed do not necessarily address disclosures through other media, such as a company’s website or a press release. Originality/value: Sustainability and commitment to the sustainable development goals (SDGs) are more likely to exist in companies that have good governance and, in particular, a better board. The research is inspired by the SDGs. The study aims to examine the relationship between carbon disclosure and corporate governance in the context of SDGs. Indeed, this research work contributes to achieving sustainability goals, including climate actions (SDG13) and clean energy adoption (SDG7). © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Carbon disclosure; Carbon disclosure project (CDP); Climate change; Corporate accountability; Corporate governance; Sustainable development goals (SDGs)",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139978753

We briefly depict the organizational differences between multinational enterprises (MNEs) and multinational platforms (MNPs), followed by a closer look at how social responsibility of digital platforms might depart from our conventional understanding derived from MNEs. We then propose the notion of ecosystem social responsibility emphasizing social value co-creation before categorizing the main areas of social issues specific to MNPs. Based on these ideas, we derive several new insights into the social challenges faced by firms governing global platforms versus multidomestic platforms, respectively, as they serve international markets.

These squids are straddling stocks exploited during their ontogenetic migrations both within exclusive economic zones of coastal States and in adjacent high seas. At present, fisheries of these squids lack an agreement to undertake comprehensive international stock assessments and management, resulting in minimal data exchanges among coastal States and those fishing in the high seas. In the high seas, there is little to no regulation and control of fishing activities, with very limited information on catch and effort. However, the high seas have been very important for commercial exploitation of both species, with annual averages of 45% of the total I. argentinus catch and 30–40% of the total D. gigas catch over the last decade. With uncontrolled harvest in the high seas, and without any unified international regulation, these straddling squid resources are highly vulnerable to overfishing; especially during years of poor recruitment and low abundance. Recent dramatic increases of fishing pressure pose a significant threat to the sustainability of these globally important squid resources. A proposal to reduce the risk of squid stocks depletion would be the establishment of a multi-national advisory forum to explicitly monitor stocks, coordinate assessment of population dynamics, and provide management recommendations for cephalopod fisheries around the world. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Advisory forum; Dosidicus gigas; Exploitation; Illex argentinus; Management; RFMO",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139974978

Disruptive technologies (DTs) have the inherent capability to affect the performance of energy infrastructure projects. Therefore, this research aims to explore the implications of DTs on the performance of energy infrastructure projects. Design/methodology/approach: This research adopts a positivist philosophical position. A quantitative strategy and deductive approach (based on a survey design) guided this study. Sixty-six respondents participated in the study. The study’s population comprised of experts in energy infrastructure projects who possessed a high level of industrial experience including top- and middle-level management of power generation companies. Cochran’s formula was used to select a sufficient sample for the study. Linear regression, one sample test and Cronbach’s alpha were the analytical tools adopted. Findings: This study established that there is an 18.4% increase in the performance of energy infrastructure projects in Ghana when DTs are applied. In order of importance, DTs improve speed of operations in energy projects; reduce operating cost and enhance efficiency of energy projects; drive sustainable economic development; enhance security in energy projects; and improve environmental sustainability of projects. The study also revealed that e-commerce technologies, renewable energy technologies, three-dimensional printing, bar code technology, photogrammetry, global positioning systems, geographic information systems and nanotechnologies were the topmost ranked DTs with the most impact on the performance of energy infrastructure projects. Originality/value: This is a novel investigation on the implications of DTs on the performance of Ghanaian energy infrastructure projects. This study’s practical implication is evident in both policy and practice. Energy sector policymakers should endeavour to adopt DTs in their operations to enhance sustainability and performance. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Disruptive technologies; Energy; Infrastructure; Performance","3D printers; Bar codes; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Philosophical aspects; Renewable energy resources; Design/methodology/approach; Disruptive technology; Energy; Energy infrastructures; Energy programs; High costs; Infrastructure; Infrastructure project; Performance; Survey design; Sustainable development",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139972599

Values and trust are critical components of policy support. Value similarity is an established concept that maps well to indicators of policy support whereas trustworthiness has received limited research attention, particularly in comparison to the variably defined concept of trust. We present a conceptual model that assesses the relationships among salient value similarity (SVS), trustworthiness (ability and benevolence), and support for wildlife policy in Arkansas, USA. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test our model among a sample of resident waterfowl hunters ≥18 years old (n = 1,596). Respondents rated the value similarity of Arkansas Game and Fish Commission (AGFC), AGFC's trustworthiness in relation to waterfowl management, and support for waterfowl policy. The measurement model fit observed data well and the structural model indicated good fit between the conceptual model and observed data. Our findings indicate SVS positively influenced perceptions of trustworthiness that, in turn, positively influenced support for waterfowl policy. The significant positive influence SVS and trustworthiness have on policy support suggest important metrics agencies can proactively track and manage among affected publics. Furthermore, knowledge of how value similarity and trustworthiness interact with policy support can help agencies target involvement and engagement processes that improve social feasibility, particularly when a policy does not correspond with current expectations but are intended to benefit the long-term socioecological sustainability of a resource. © 2022 The Authors.

Consequently, designers must meet the circular economy (CE) requirements, but also provide creative solutions. The present research describes an experiment in which a group of designers were asked to solve design problems using two different methods: random stimuli and biomimicry. The results help to answer the question regarding whether methods focused on requirements (biological requirements in this case) are as effective for obtaining creative solutions as methods oriented toward creative ideas (specifically random stimuli). The paper also examines whether biomimicry stimuli promote circularity to a sufficiently greater extent than a random stimulus to compensate for the possible loss of creativity with respect to the random method. The results show that biomimicry stimuli promote circularity in the concepts without diminishing their creativity. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Biologically inspired design; collaborative creativity; concept generation; creativity process",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139967612

This has been driven not least by a wish to understand technology, energy demand, and how it might be understood in terms of social practices. In this paper, we reflect on several studies that have sought to capture this relationship. We introduce an evolving methodological approach we term ‘Resource Trace Interviewing’ that extends interview practice using visualizations of fine-grained quantitative data from sensors and software deployed in the home. By facilitating fuller accounts and joint sense-making between participants and researchers, this method better reveals the patterns of technology and energy use in the digitally connected home, and how this in turn relates to domestic practices. We reflect, for the first time, on the strengths and limitations of this approach as a guide to others studying similar socio-technical settings. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","domestic practice; energy demand; ICT; Mixed-methods; sustainability","Sustainable development; Design community; Domestic practice; Energy demands; Fine grained; ICT; Interaction design; Methodological approach; Mixed method; Quantitative data; Social practices; Energy management",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139967153

This becomes even more of concern since an FPP will be breeding more tritium than is burned in the reactor for sustainability. The IPI is the tritium moving through the system that is not in the storage and delivery subsystem. A process model that solves time-dependent differential equations based on processing times was used to investigate the reduction of the IPI of a potential fuel cycle design. The impact of new and more efficient technologies such as direct internal recycling (DIR), metal foil pumps, continuous pumping, improved isotope separation, and hydrogen separating continuous pumps on IPI was investigated by adjusting subsystem processing times and material flow streams. It was shown that any of the insertions of DIR studied in this paper caused a reduction in the total IPI of the system and proved to be the optimal way to reduce the IPI in the system. Fuel cycle modifications near the torus, such as a coupled DIR and improved pumping systems, produced the largest reductions in tritium inventory. © 2022 Battelle Savannah River Alliance, LLC.","direct internal recycling; fuel cycle; Fusion; inventory; tritium","Differential equations; Fuels; Pilot plants; Pumps; Tritium; % reductions; Direct internal recycling; Fuel cycle; Fusion fuel; In-process inventories; Inventory; Inventory reductions; Processing time; Reduction studies; Time based; Recycling",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139964388

Current agents like xanthine oxidase inhibitors prevent hyperuricemia, but usually induce severe side effects. Alternative strategies, such as novel dietary supplementations, are necessary for the management of hyperuricemia. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been used in human diet for a long time with a good safety record. In this study, 345 LAB strains isolated from traditional fermented dairy products were tested for assimilating abilities of guanosine. Two LAB strains, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 1155 (LR1155) and Limosilactobacillus fermentum 2644 (LF2644), showing great capacities of guanosine transformation and degradation were selected. Compared to LR1155, LF2644 showed a better effect with 100.00% transforming rate and 55.10% degrading rate. In an in vivo test, a hyperuricemic rat model was established and the results showed that administration of LR1155 (p < 0.01) or LF2644 (p < 0.01) prevented the rise of serum uric acid with more than 20% decrease when compared with the hyperuricemia rats. In addition, an increased fecal uric acid level was observed in LF2644 or LR1155 treated rats (LR1155-M p < 0.05, others p < 0.01). This study proved that LR1155 and LF2644 can be promising candidates of dietary supplements for prevention or improvement of hyperuricemia. Practical Application: The LAB strains tested in this study could be considered as good potential probiotic candidates for dietary supplements because of their urate-lowering effects, which provide a novel antihyperuricemic strategy with advantages of safety and sustainability. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.","dietary supplements; hyperuricemia; lactic acid bacteria (LAB); probiotics; uric acid",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139961243

This study draws on a framework which operationalizes three-dimensions of well-being: material, relational, and subjective, in order to measure the range of benefits and disbenefits experienced by local communities from protected areas. 308 respondents from two coastal Kenyan villages adjacent to the Watamu Marine National Reserve participated in a telephone survey in June and July 2020. The study recorded varying levels of dependency on the marine environment for the livelihoods of residents. A key finding of this study was that benefits reported by participants consistently exceeded disbenefits. A principal components analysis identified that the number of benefits and disbenefits experienced explained the most variance within the dataset. The benefits and disbenefits reported contributed to each dimension of human well-being. The highest ranked benefits reported contributed to subjective well-being (‘better health’, and ‘ability to enjoy a clean and healthy creek and ocean’), and the most frequently reported disbenefits related to relational and material well-being (for instance ‘increased conflict and social tension’ ‘increased poverty’, ‘fewer supplies of food’). Practical local conservation efforts can address relational disbenefits through better partnership working, and material disbenefits by supporting pro-conservation, alternative livelihoods. The findings demonstrate the relevance of understanding social trends for marine protected area governance and management. The paper offers insights into how fundamental relations between protected marine environments, livelihoods, and well-being may affect the perceptions and success of conservation initiatives amongst local communities. © 2022 The Author(s).

Life cycle sustainability assessment is a tool to identify social, economic, and environmental aspects of raw materials, but it is mostly used for negative impacts, whereas the supply and use of raw materials may also lead to benefits. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can help to determine how raw materials boost or hinder the achievement of a sustainable society. In this study, the SDGs were used as a reference to assess contributions and risks of cobalt supply for electric mobility in the EU and whether this technology supports the achievement of the SDGs. The risks were determined using eight indicators focused on social risks, but environmental aspects like water quality and usage, and greenhouse gas emissions were also considered. The literature and databases were consulted to identify which SDGs receive contributions or burdens. Global and European cobalt supply scenarios were defined, considering the most representative countries. Results indicate that, although some SDGs receive positive contributions, like SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth) and SDG 13 (Climate action), most of the identified correlations are negative, especially for SDG 3 (Good health and well-being) and SDG 16 (Peace, justice, and strong institutions).

Design/methodology/approach: This study applied focus group interviews from 12 hotel managers and accessed the hotel’s internal database to identify the latest and innovative service attributes offered by the hotels. The information regarding the green practices offered by the hotels was collected through TripAdvisor and LEED-IGBC website. It identified 10 independent and four dependent variables based on previous literature. Guest’s revisit intentions were measured on a five-point Likert scale. Data was analysed using a multi-step hierarchical regression model. Findings: The use of green practices by the hotels revealed a positive and significant influence on the guest’s revisit-intentions and their intention to pay a premium price. It was also found that the use of new and innovative green practices has a positive influence on the guest’s overall online evaluation of the hotel. Practical implications: This study suggests that the amalgamation of green practices along with the conventional service attributes may help in the incremental revisit and online hotel assessment intentions, which might be of use for the managers and hotel policymakers.

In the current study, a novel omega-3 fatty acid-rich microalgal strain was isolated and identified as Desmodesmus sp. Dal Lake Kashmir (DLK) based on its morphology and molecular characterization. Its potential as biofuel feedstock was established based on its appropriate fatty acid profile and enhanced lipid productivity. The growth of Desmodesmus sp. DLK was evaluated using varying concentrations of three exogenous carbon sources (glucose, glycerol and sodium acetate) to examine the potential of the freshwater microalga to ameliorate biomass and lipid production for proficient biofuel production. A phenomenal enhancement in biomass productivity (12.8-fold) and lipid productivity (22-fold) was detected with 1% glucose in comparison to control. Supplementation with glycerol boosted the productivity of biomass and lipid maximum by 11.4-fold (5 g.L−1 gly) and 26.8-fold (10 g.L−1 gly), respectively. Analyses of fatty acid methyl esters from mixotrophically grown culture, via gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, exhibited a prevalence of palmitic acid (C16:0; 37%) and oleic acid (C18:1; 53%) demonstrating desirable properties for biofuel quality.

Materials and technologies are developed regularly to help address challenges posed by rising populations and related energy demands and emissions. The purpose of this study is to investigate decisions that influence materials selection for sustainable upgrade of existing structures and identify the extent to which environmental factors are applied. The study adopted a quantitative approach that involved an extensive literature review and a survey questionnaire randomly distributed to professionals in the construction industry as a way of identifying innovative sustainable upgrade decisions. A Mann-Whitey U test analysis was applied to establish decisions affecting materials selection. The results show materials selection decisions for sustainable upgrade of existing structures are focused on cost and physical properties including demand for materials, cost of sustainable upgrade, colour and texture of construction materials. Policy decisions and implementation strategies are required to improve environmental sustainability, and thereby reduce the negative effects of construction on the climate. Environmental considerations do not influence decisions on materials selection as much as cost, physical and aesthetics factors. © 2022 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.","case study; environment; existing buildings; materials selection; sustainable upgrade; technology and innovation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139940070

Second, making fundamental progress towards these goals requires secure, quality, short-time work for all. This refers to an economic system that would guarantee everyone a decent, secure, existence at roughly 30 hours or less of market work, as well as actively discouraging longer hours. This discouragement should take the form of “soft” state policies as well as new cultural norms; it should not take “hard” forms of state violence. Third, liberal proceduralists are wrong to believe that individuals should be free from state regulation to simply choose the amount of work/leisure that they see fit, since doing so creates all kinds of harms for other people. In fact, the state should actively disincentivize long work hours in order to augment social justice. © 2022 Caucus for a New Political Science.","free time; gender equality; justice; part-time work; perfectionism; Short-time work; sustainability; time poverty",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139939982

Manufacturing industries follow different protocols and receive different certifications for water management and efficiency in their plants, which are also labelled on the packaging. Nowadays, consumers appear to be increasingly concerned about environmental challenges, therefore many sustainability labels have been developed (carbon, water, ecological footprint) to facilitate consumers to make more sustainable choices concerning their purchases. Consumers’ behaviour towards carbon footprint labels has been thoroughly examined in international literature; however, WF labelling studies are very limited. The key to water efficiency labelling in consumer products could be the water footprint (WF), as it measures the total volume of freshwater used to produce a product, over the full supply chain, including virtual water, “hidden” in the products, services and processes. The implementation of WF labelling of consumer products in Greece was investigated, using a questionnaire with demographical data and statements on water sustainability. The results indicate that younger consumers are not quite aware of environmental challenges related to water. According to the findings, WF could be an effective marketing driver towards water sustainability since consumers prefer a quantified label concerning water consumption, regardless of their educational level, and they are willing to pay an extra price for water sustainable products even if they have an unstable job. Manufacturers could then promote their sustainable profile and performance effectively by adopting a WF relevant labelling. © 2022, The Author(s).","Consumer preferences; Greek survey; Green marketing driver; Water footprint; Water labelling; Water use efficiency",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139939125

The large amount of laundry wastewater (LWW) is generated by extensive human activities. LWW needs to be treated in order to tackle the challenging problem of water pollution and to accomplish water sustainability. To achieve this success, LWW can be reused for several purposes such as irrigation, construction activities, vehicle washing etc. However, there are several challenges in the reclamation of LWW like effective handling of the wastewater and meeting the regulatory criteria. Based on the literature review it seems that a single treatment process is not sufficient to treat LWW up to acceptable reuse standards. To that end, different treatment chains have been proposed: i) hybrid processes combining membrane filtration with adsorption; ii) advanced oxidation process using ultraviolet (UV) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); iii) coagulation-flocculation combined with sand filtration; iv) combination of ozonation process, adsorption, and ultrafiltration (UF). This review paper discusses the selection of suitable treatment technology depends on several factors: i) a well-designed equipment, ii) cost-effectiveness of treatment method and iii) desired characteristics of the treated water.

The aim of the current study was to examine an implementation of peer support from the perspective of managers in order to develop knowledge of factors influencing sustainability of this initiative. Eighteen managers were interviewed in connection with the introduction of peer support in sixteen mental health settings. Interviews were analyzed utilizing inductive and deductive approaches. The results suggested that managers were predominantly positive in their evaluation of peer support as a recovery-oriented addition to their services, but noted developmental issues regarding role, professional identity, supervision and financing in relation to other traditional personnel. The involvement of the user movement, especially with regard to training and supervision helped prepare staff and support peer workers, yet there was some apprehension attached to the critical scrutiny that this `outsider’ perspective might imply. The results confirm previously noted uncertainties regarding peer support as an integrated component of mental health systems and illuminate a number of culturally conditioned challenges that may hamper peer support from being implemented with the same approach as other interventions. In response, the present study suggests a number of focus areas that should be attended to in future implementation efforts, including issues related to staff roles, power dynamics, connection to the user movement and reconsideration of the value of experience-based knowledge. In the Swedish context, a government level commitment was identified as critical to ensure stable funding. © 2022, The Author(s).","Manager perspectives; Mental health services; Peer support; Sustainable implementation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139936854

Authenticity is an important aspect of micro-foundations of CSR in shaping the way social responsibility initiatives would impact the stakeholders including the customers, partners, current members of the organization and shareholders. This calls for a need to synthesize past research on CSR authenticity in order to propose directions for future research. Design/methodology/approach: The current study synthesizes relevant literature on CSR authenticity using systematic literature review (SLR) approach. In total, 34 research works were identified and examined to seek insights on CSR authenticity. Findings: Findings of the study identified various miro-, meso- and macro-level determinants of CSR authenticity and different set of outcomes having implications on business and society. The study also proposes a comprehensive definition of CSR authenticity which was somewhat missing in existing literature. Practical implications: The study provides strong theoretical and managerial implications. Particularly, the study provides directions for future research on the topic.

We review recent advances in institutional economics closely tied to developments in philosophy of mind and cognitive science, involving extended and enactive cognition. We argue that the analysis of different conceptions of institutional mind extension, in Denzau and North’s shared mental models, Clark’s extended mind, and a more enactive approach that emphasizes the importance of social interaction and personal relationships, can benefit from Kathrine Hawley’s distinction between reliability and trust. Institutional arrangements based solely on the reliability of impersonal mechanisms can lead to a variety of social pathologies and, at the extreme, a form of cognitive atrophy, all of which can undermine the sustainability of institutions. Even if trust comes with risks and some degree of unpredictability, it turns out to be a necessary glue-like ingredient in the constitution of social institutions. © 2022 The Author(s).

Massive quantities of cashew by-products (nut shell, testa shell, nut meal, and bagasse) are produced during cashew industrial processing, with adverse environmental and economic effects. These residual biomasses still contain relevant content of bioactive or functional compounds, making their recovery an excellent opportunity to increase the sustainability and profitability of cashew production chains. Generally, these waste materials are disposed of incorrectly; however, if they are valorized for more adequate and complete uses, they can generate different products depending on the recovery routes. This review addresses this subject by covering significant studies and presenting the state-of-the-art strategies for extracting compounds with high-value-added from cashew by-products. The main idea is to use the biorefinery and circular economy concept using sequential extraction techniques to obtain several valuable products with prospects for applications in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics industries. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Agro-industrial biomasses; Circular economy; Green technologies; Sequential processes","Industrial economics; Refining; Sustainable development; Agro-industrial biomass; Biorefineries; By products recovery; Circular economy; Global scale; Green technology; Health effects; Massive quantities; Nut-shells; Sequential process; Recovery",Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139918338

However, the possible contributions of the compact city environment to the increase (or decrease) in public transportation use have been understudied. To fill this gap, the current case study examines psychological factors influencing citizens’ intention to use public transportation modes in the compact city environment in Toyama City, Japan. We focused on citizens’ perception, attitudes, and behaviors, as they play important roles in sustainable development initiatives. Survey questionnaires were used to collect data, and structural equation modeling was performed to analyze 973 respondents’ transportation mode choices. The theoretical foundations underlying this study include the norm-activation theory and the theory of planned behavior. The findings suggest that attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and behavioral norms served as significant factors to explain the intention to use public transportation modes.

The nonreductive CO2 fixation into epoxides to prepare cyclic carbonates has gained attention in recent years. In this work, we report the development of guanidine hydrochloride-functionalized γalumina (-Al2O3), prepared using green solvents, as an efficient bifunctional catalyst for CO2 fixation. The resulting guanidine-grafted -Al2O3 (Al-Gh) proved to be an excellent catalyst to prepare cyclic carbonates from epoxides and CO2 with high selectivity. The nitrogen-rich Al-Gh shows increased CO2 adsorption capacity compared to that of -Al2O3. The as-prepared catalyst was able to carry out CO2 fixation at 85 °C under atmospheric pressure in the absence of solvents and external additives (e.g., TBAI or KI). The material showed negligible loss of catalytic activity even after five cycles of catalysis. The catalyst successfully converted many epoxides into their respective cyclic carbonates under the optimized conditions. The gram-scale synthesis of commercially important styrene carbonates from styrene oxide and CO2 using Al-Gh was also achieved. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the role of alumina in activating the epoxide. This activation facilitated the chloride ion to open the ring to react with CO2. The DFT studies also validated the role of alumina in stabilizing the electron-rich intermediates during the course of the reaction. © 2022 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139909865

It suggests that in Jamaican there are ideological, practical, and structural impediments that stifle initiative and capacity for change work. Local research suggests teacher educators have awareness of ESD work but lack the competences needed to promote sustainability. They also lack a rationale powerful enough to make ESD personally and professionally meaningful to them. The paper makes a case for encouraging teacher educators to strengthen their ethic of caring in response to the serious issue of crime and violence in Jamaican schools. It posits this may be the impetus needed to encourage mainstreaming caring into teacher education. This would allow educators to experience how caring work can promote social and cultural change. Since the values that underpin caring work in teacher education are like those that underpin caring in sustainability work, it is possible teacher educators will be motivated to use their enhanced competences for caring in new ways. If caring is positioned as the core of teacher educators’ philosophy and practice, it can become a foundational ideology. This could strengthen possibilities for our teacher education institutions to develop institutional cultures that embrace ESD and are willing to mainstream sustainability. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","barriers to mainstreaming ESD; ideology of caring; Mainstreaming ESD",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139906364

An alternative promotional scheme is one where consumers receive a coupon for a second item available for free at a later time. Our work is motivated by British supermarkets which, facing criticism from lawmakers for running BOGOF promotions on perishables, started a “BOGOF Later” campaign with the claim that it would reduce the amount of waste. Food waste is indeed a very pressing issue, which has not yet been explored in connection to sales promotions. We compare the impact of these promotion schemes on a retailer's profit as well as on the amount of product wasted at the retail and household levels. We consider two possible applications: unexpected high inventory of a fresh product with a short shelflife and excess leftover inventory for an item at the end of its season or product life. We propose a two-period newsvendor model which captures the sales-boosting effect of promotions, the postpromotion sales drop due to satiation, the coupon-redemption behavior, and the increased consumer wastage rate from BOGOF promotions. We obtain analytical comparisons of order quantity, profit, and waste across the different promotion schemes and use numerical experiments to generate further insights. We find that, in general, BOGOF promotions are profitable ways to liquidate inventory. In many instances, the increase in waste at the consumers' homes is offset by the decrease in waste at the retail store. As a result, BOGOF promotions often constitute “win-win propositions” by simultaneously increasing the retailer's profit and decreasing total waste. Overall, our results paint a more favorable picture of the BOGOF promotion scheme than commonly perceived and suggest that its environmental criticism emanates from a too narrow and too consumer-centric view of the waste problem. © 2022 Production and Operations Management Society.","buy-one-get-one-free; coupons; food waste; sales promotions; sustainability; waste",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139879714

In this context, agro-derived lignins have the potential for cosmetics applications. Thus, this study investigated the photoprotective activity and skin irritation potential (OECD TG 439 with SkinVitro-RHE, an in-house reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) model) of a kraft lignin (LE) and two LE-derived lignins modified by enzymatic reactions to achieve higher molecular weight (Mw) (R1: intermediate Mw and E60: highest Mw). Results showed that LE and R1 lignins present adequate photoprotective activity with averages Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 33.8 ± 0.02 and 22.7 ± 0.04, respectively. The E60 also present adequate SPF (22.4 ± 0.2); however, due to its poor solubility, this lignin has potential application as a physical filter. In terms of safety, these lignins did not cause skin irritation or cellular and structural damage to the epidermis. Additionally, using an analysis based on the autofluorescence feature of lignin, no sign of the tested lignins was found in exposed RHE models, indicating that these three lignins did not penetrate the skin. Altogether, the results indicate a promising application of kraft lignins for sunscreen products regarding safer alternatives and product sustainability. Also, the SkinVitro-RHE showed to be a good model for evaluating the skin irritation potential of substances, including natural cosmetic ingredients. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Lignins; Natural cosmetic ingredients; Reconstructed human epidermis; Skin irritation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139878197

The paper examines how the notion of commodification informed the policies on water, land and local democracy, impacting the governance of rural community ponds in the state of Kerala, India. The review shows that while earlier country-level policies largely showed a tendency to treat water as a commodity, decommodification tendencies are perceptible in the water policy of Kerala. Nonetheless, the land reforms in Kerala resulted in Dalit Bahujans being systematically excluded from accessing land, even though it ended the operation of commoditised human bodies, and enforced land ceilings. Huge tracts of plantations were kept out of the purview of land reforms, signifying the operation of commodification. A positive aspect of the land ceilings was that many private enclosures like rural ponds were transferred to the state. The reforms in local democracy, to a great extent, led to accessible policy-making. The framework of ‘double movement’ is useful in analysing the trends in environmental sociology and evaluating policies related to socio-ecological systems. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Commodification; commons; double movement; India; Kerala; public policy; social justice; sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139877924

Although demand for a material varies strongly by region and end-use sector, statistical models of demand typically predict demand using regression analyses at an aggregated global level (“fully pooled models”). “Un-pooled” regression models that predict demand at a disaggregated country or regional level face challenges due to limited data availability and large uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that can simultaneously identify heterogeneous demand parameters (like price and income elasticities) for individual regions and sectors, as well as global parameters. We demonstrate the model's value by estimating income and price elasticity of copper demand in five sectors (Transportation, Electrical, Construction, Manufacturing, and Other) and five regions (North America, Europe, Japan, China, and Rest of World). To validate the benefits of the Bayesian approach, we compare the model to both a “fully pooled” and an “un-pooled” model. The Bayesian model can predict global demand with similar uncertainty as a fully pooled regression model, while additionally capturing regional heterogeneity in income elasticity of demand. Compared to un-pooled models that predict demand for individual countries and sectors separately, our model reduces the uncertainty of parameter estimates by more than 50%. The hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach we propose can be used for various commodities, improving material demand projections used to study the impact of policies on mining sector emissions and informing investment in critical material production. © 2022 The Authors.

Repertory grid technique helped to identify the dimensions through which persons evaluate urban landscape quality. Ninety-three (93) interviewees elicited 1400 bipolar constructs, such as “Edible green – Concrete” or “Community, group – Loneliness”. They then selected two constructs they consider most relevant in the context of urban sustainability transitions, and ranked all pictures on a 10-points scale. The rankings were analyzed using Multiple Correspondence Analysis. We find that, in spite of the many social and cultural differences between the regions, stakeholders largely agree on the preferred direction of urban transitions; more green and blue spots where people can meet and undertake joint (leisure) activities. The main conflict is between, on the one hand, a preference for organized development and beautification and, on the other hand, naturalness (permeability of soil) and organic development.

The question however is, how inclusive and sustainable is this growth? With this in mind, this study examined the sustainability and inclusiveness of economic growth in a panel of 44 SSA countries, over a period of 38 years, while taking into account the diversity of the continent's institutional quality, income growth and resource endowment. The study adopts the innovative nonlinear fiscal reaction function and the dynamic panel threshold model to account for potential asymmetric phenomena in public debt series. The study also adopts Driscoll and Kraay's estimator to account for cross-section dependency and cross-country heterogeneity. The result shows that the recent increase in the economic growth rate in SSA is not sustainable and inclusive. This is tenable since if economic growth is debt induced, more money will be spent on servicing public debt, thus depriving governments of funds for critical intervention programs. Lastly, the study found a public debt/gross domestic product ratio threshold of 34% beyond which public debt impairs growth inclusiveness across SSA.

However, one issue limiting Nile tilapia expansion in arid and semi-arid areas is the scarcity of freshwater resources. In this study, the supplementation of synbiotics was investigated to enhance the growth performance, growth-related genes, intestinal health, and immunity of Nile tilapia reared in inland brackish groundwater. Four diets were prepared where the basal diets were mixed with the dietary mixture of probiotics and prebiotics (Synbiotic Lactic Dry®, a blend of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecium, and Bacillus subtilis, mannan oligosaccharides and β-1.3/1.6-D-glucan) at 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 g/kg. After eight weeks, the final weight and weight gain are linearly increasing with increasing the supplementation level of synbiotic. Markedly fish fed 0.5, 1, and 2 g/kg of synbiotic had higher final weight, weight gain, and feed intake and lower feed conversion ratio (FCR) than fish fed synbiotic free diet. The specific growth rate (SGR) was significantly higher in fish fed 1 and 2 g/kg than in fish fed 0 and 0.5 g/kg. The intestine of fish fed on synbiotic shows an increase in intestinal villi density. Further, the intestine of fish fed on synbiotic showed an increase in the length and branching intestinal villi (anterior, middle, and posterior) in a dose-dependent manner. The lysozyme and phagocytic activities were significantly different from the control, while synbiotic supplementation did not affect the phagocytic index. Interestingly, the results showed marked upregulation of ghrelin, IGF-1, and GH genes in fish fed synbiotics at 0.5, 1, and 2 g/kg. In addition, fish fed 2 g/kg had the highest expression of ghrelin, IGF-1, and GH genes. In conclusion, growing Nile tilapia in inland brackish groundwater can be achieved without negative impacts on the growth performance and health status. Supplementing synbiotics (1-2 g/kg) in Nile tilapia feeds enhanced the growth and feed performances, intestinal histomorphological features, growth-related genes, and immune response. © Fawzy I.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic exerted unprecedented pressure on health care systems, professionals and management systems. Health care organizations begin to explore their roles and function in relation to risks and resilience, in addition to ascertain what level of organization support they are providing to their workers. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with a questionnaire administered to 538 health care workers, to examine their personal resources and organizational support during the pandemic. Results: A total of 37.7% of nurses were found to have a moderate level of resilience, logistic regression showed that being married is a protective factor against resigning from the profession (OR = 0.462, P =.012, 95% CI: 0.254–0.842), and health care workers who perceived higher organizational support were approximately 50% less likely to have a turnover intention (OR = 0.506, P =.009, 95% CI: 0.303–0.845). Multiple linear regression model indicated significantly higher resilience among physicians (β = 0.12, P <.05) and allied health care practitioners (β = 0.12, P =.022). Organizational support had a significant positive relationship with resilience scores (β = 0.20, P <.001); adequate training was significantly related to higher compassion levels (β = 0.11, P <.05) and high organizational support scores were associated with increased compassion scores (β = 0.27, P <.001). Conclusions: Front-line health care workers reported moderate organizational support during the pandemic, commensurately reflected in moderate levels of personal resilience and self-compassion. Continued and better support is vital for employee sustainability and the increased health system performance, including quality of care and patient outcomes. Implications for nursing management: Nurse managers should help health care workers improve self-care strategies by strengthening personal resources, including shortened duty hours, offering adequate break time, providing a safe work climate and purveying adequate personal protective equipment and supplies to combat infections. They should build an empathetic work environment through understanding the needs of staff, helping tackle their work stress and sustaining cultures of compassion through promoting rewarding and flexibility strategies. Moreover, policymakers and nurse mangers should create a rewarding culture for nurses and other health care workers to increase their commitment to their jobs. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","health care workers; organizational support; pandemic; resilience; self-compassion; United Arab Emirates",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139857673

Fundamentally, interactions between socioeconomic, socioecological, and technological factors determine sustainable development. Para rubber is a vital feedstock for bio-based industries. However, utilizing para rubber resources inefficiently can be a barrier to the desirable shift towards a CE system and sustainable development. In this present study, the sustainability factors enhancing the implementation of the CE potential of Para rubber resources in Songkhla province, southern Thailand, was evaluated. The classical Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) were complementarily used to evaluate the main factors and sub-criteria for para rubber CE potential. The findings revealed the factors that will facilitate the implementation of para rubber CE and enhance sustainable development in the following order of priority: resource (0.420)> development (0.177)> environment (0.162)> economy (0.127)> population (0.114). Consequently, the para rubber resource has been identified as a bioeconomic gem in Thailand, with the potential to facilitate CE and enhance sustainable development in the study area. This study is useful to all stakeholders, including policymakers, in promoting para rubber resource efficiency, sustainable consumption and production trends at the national, provincial, and district levels, as well as improve the social, economic, ecological, and cultural resilience of rural areas.

Although concrete’s importance as a building material cannot be overstated, the traditional preparation of concrete is associated with enormous greenhouse gas emissions as well as unsustainable use of limited resources. Concrete consists of four components: cement, water, sand, and coarse aggregate, and the investigation of more sustainable alternatives to each component of concrete is an active area of research. In this activity, students prepare and test traditional concrete and compare its strength to some of the alternatives using a guided inquiry-based experimental method. This allows the students to participate in an important research field and potentially prepares future industry leaders to appreciate low carbon materials.

While the SSCM literature offers many examples of buyers’ decoupling, few publications focus on decoupling by suppliers, who are under pressure from buyers to adopt formal structures, i.e. social sustainability policies. There are even fewer studies exploring workers’ claims related to social issues in this regard. Our study, drawing on the concept of policy-practice decoupling, investigates how suppliers navigate the different expectations of buyers and factory-level workers to find ‘decouple-able’ policies when practising social sustainability. We apply the stakeholder salience theoretical lens to analyse 44 interviews from fieldwork in Vietnam to uncover who and what really counts for local supplier managers in selective decoupling. Along with enriching our understanding of decoupling done by local suppliers, our study uncovers the influence of workers on their managers in shaping and reshaping decoupling. © 2022 Kedge Business School.","garment supply chain; local suppliers; Policy-practice decoupling; social sustainability; stakeholder salience",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139835375

However, the potential high NOx emissions and the reduced oxidation process stability, at least when conventional combustion plants are used, can burden its wide utilization on large scales. In this context, MILD Combustion, due to its inherent characteristics, may greatly improve combustion stability and keep the NOx emissions at an acceptable level. On the other hand, the addition of low or no-carbon fuels from biomasses and wastes, more reactive than ammonia, may be beneficial in further improving its combustion performance and the global sustainability of the energy supply chain. In this respect, the present work analyzes the sustainability and combustion performance of binary mixtures of ammonia and low-molecular-weight alcohols in a cyclonic burner, where MILD conditions are attained by means of a strong internal recirculation, and compares them with those obtained with NH3/methane blends. Results highlighted that NH3/alcohols mixtures ensure a stable oxidation process in a wide range of operational parameters without compromising the system performance. Moreover, they showed a significant reduction of NOx emissions for NH3/alcohols mixtures, especially for fuel-lean conditions, when compared to NH3/methane blends. Experimental data were also corroborated by chemical kinetic modeling results to provide some insights on the peculiar NOx formation routes when blends of different nature are used, highlighting the interaction between carbon and nitrogen fuels kinetics. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Many enterprises employ emerging information technology (IT) to reduce supply chain vulnerability and enhance supply chain resilience. Technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain facilitate more robust supply chain operations, such as remanufacturing, just-in-time production, and automated workflow, leading to corporate sustainability along economic, environmental, and social dimensions. From a dynamic capability perspective, this article conceptualizes emerging IT capability and investigates its role in helping enterprises survive supply chain disruptions and prosper in the long run. A research model depicts the relationships among environmental uncertainty, supply chain vulnerability vigilance, emerging IT capability, supply chain resilience, and corporate sustainability. A partial least square analysis on survey observations collected from more than 200 enterprises in China that are highly susceptible to supply chain disruptions provides supporting evidence to most research hypotheses. The results show that high vigilance to potential supply chain disruptions will motivate enterprises to develop emerging IT capability, which will enhance supply chain resilience as well as economic, environmental, and social performances. The mediating role of emerging IT capability suggests a viable path for enterprises to adapt to the increasingly turbulent environment and improve supply chain resilience and corporate sustainability.

However, the earlier CHOSYN design approaches presumed that the networks operate in a single mode throughout the year. This may not be the case in real-world situations where the production of certain plants such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) from bio-based glycerol may require multiple operational modes to accommodate the seasonal variability and availability of raw material. PHAs are biodegradable polymers produced by bacterial fermentation of carbon sources, which are the potential substitutions for petrochemical-based plastics. Hence, this work aims to propose a systematic approach to optimize multiperiod mass integration in the development of a CHOSYN. The central principle of the proposed approach is the incorporation of a storage and dispatch system into the conventional CHOSYN design for the supply of chemical species needed in the network throughout different operational periods. A case study considering glycerol valorization and other chemical plants using the devised CHOSYN model was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed design against the conventional CHOSYN in terms of sustainability metrics. The results demonstrate the advantages of the CHOSYN model with a storage and dispatch system by exhibiting a better profitability outcome than the conventional multiperiod CHOSYN through operating cost savings. © 2022 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139824569

However, several challenges influence the adoption of sustainability and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This study aimed (i) to identify the adoption barriers of sustainability and I4.0 and (ii) to establish the interrelationship among these barriers for SMEs. An extensive literature search supported by interviews with supply chain practitioners from three SMEs identified 12 critical barriers to adoption. The barriers are then ranked using ‘Interpretive Structural Modeling’. The results suggest that the ‘lack of resources’ and the ‘lack of employee’s competence/expertise’ are the most influencing barriers. Changing government regulations on the allocation of capital and financial incentives for SMEs to encourage training and skills development programs could promote sustainable supply chains and practices.

ICT is an essential tool in the oil and gas industry and plays a complementary role in technological dynamics and cross-sectoral productivity. For the educational sector, ICT facilitates research and development as well as in imparting knowledge. ICT remains the password to essential inputs required for any given output in terms of improved productivity and economic development. With regard to employment creation, ICT accounts for more than 50% of employment globally. Despite the significant role of ICT in the economy, evidence shows that more than 90% of carbon emissions have been linked to ICT production, installation, and usage. This study aims to determine whether ICT causes environmental sustainability in Nigeria and South Africa. The methodological contribution of the study lies in combining the STIRPAT framework and time series based on the VAR/VEC Granger causality, enabling the study to uncouple the dynamic interaction among environmental sustainability indicators. The findings show that ICT has contributed to South Africa’s environmental sustainability, whereas evidence in Nigeria is relatively mixed.

It introduces the dynamic risk assessment tool developed at INL, Event Modeling Risk Assessment using Linked Diagrams (EMRALD). EMRALD is leveraged to optimize the security posture of a nuclear power plant by integrating force-on-force (FOF) simulations and operator mitigation actions, including dynamic and flexible coping strategies (FLEX). To illustrate the methodology, four attack scenarios are modeled in a commercially available FOF simulation tool using a hypothetical nuclear power plant facility. The simulation results provide valuable insights into possible attack outcomes, as well as the probabilistic risk of a core damage event given these outcomes. Safety mitigation procedures are modeled in EMRALD dependent on the attack outcomes by considering human operator uncertainties. The results demonstrate that the number of armed responders can be optimized, while still maintaining the same protection level as the initial security posture. The proposed modeling and simulation framework of integrating FLEX equipment with FOF models enables the nuclear power plants to credit FLEX portable equipment in the plant security posture, resulting in an efficient and optimized physical security system. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, there has been a gradual paradigm shift in societal attitudes towards recognising their importance as landscape features that provide benefits for humans and wildlife. Unfortunately, construction activities have continually plagued their existence. Therefore, this present research examines the risks factors associated with construction projects in wetlands ecosystem, using Ghana as a case study. A quantitative research strategy leaning towards the positivist paradigm was adopted. A structured survey was developed to collect data from key stakeholders. Purposive sampling was employed to recruit construction experts in the Kumasi Metropolis, with a total of 78 experts agreeing to participate. Relative Importance Index (RII), Mean Score Ranking and a One-Sample T-Test were used to analyse primary data collected. The findings revealed that the key driving forces spurring construction projects in wetlands were rapid urbanisation; high rate of migration; and scarcity of land for development. Critical risks factors associated with construction projects in wetlands were identified as cost overruns; exploitation of biological resources; and water pollution. Finally, the findings also showed that the most critical detrimental effects of construction projects in wetlands were the destruction of aquatic and terrestrial lives; loss of flood control capability; and deterioration of wetland water quality. The study recommends the protection and conservation of wetlands environments through systematized enactment and enforcement of environmental protection regulations by government and non-governmental institutions. This would ensure the preservation of important biodiversity and aid with pollution control and flood protection. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","construction; ecosystem; environmental performance; sustainability; urban; Wetlands",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139784794

Decision-makers are often required to make decisions without certainty of the consequences and understanding their effects on intergenerational justice. Thus, managing the impacts of climate change requires novel decision-aiding approaches that consider climate impacts’ temporal and spatial heterogeneity and the uncertainty in climate predictions, preferences, and values. We reviewed the literature on the extent to which principles of intergenerational justice—conservation of options and resources for future generations—have been integrated to traditional approaches in climate resilience decision-making. We explore the extent to which flexibility, i.e., the conservation and expansion of options in subsequent decision periods, can contribute to upholding the principles of intergenerational justice under uncertainty. We illustrate the approach in the case of the Delta Programme in the Netherlands, a complex system designed to protect against sea-level rise (SLR). Designing adaptation strategies to SLR with flexibility as a core concept brings significant advantages in circumstances of uncertainty. The conservation of options in flexible pathways, in this case, contributes to the principles of intergenerational justice. Our civilization’s long-term sustainability and survival may depend on the extent to which individuals can see beyond their gains and toward the gains of the collective society at an intergenerational scale. © 2022, The Author(s).","Adaptive pathways; Climate change; Decision-aiding approaches; Sea-level rise",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139784614

Celery peel contains essential nutrients as much as celery root. This study aims to propose a novel framework for investigation of celery root peel waste, which has high nutritional value and is beneficial for healthy nutrition, valorization potential to re-formulate ayran (a traditional Turkish drink). Design/methodology/approach: Sustainable green extraction/distillation methods were applied to the celery root peel material to obtain water soluble extracts to be used in formulation of traditional Turkish drink “Ayran”. Findings: As a result of the study, a new functional fermented drink derived from traditional drink ayran was obtained by using celery root peel extract. In addition to the positive characteristic properties of samples in terms of physical, chemical, microbiological and sensory parameters, it was observed that it increased the shelf life by at least 50% compared to the drink from which it was derived. Originality/value: Several studies focused the valorization of food waste materials; however, to the best of the author’s knowledge, no study has been taken an approach for using green methods to add additional properties to traditional foods by using celery root peel extracts.

Participants were selected by drawing stratified samples based on the hazelnut production area in different villages. Data were collected by administering a questionnaire to hazelnut farmers. In-depth information was provided for problems encountered during the use of pressured irrigation systems for those who adopted these technologies, and reasons for non-adoption were investigated. The logit model was used to determine the factors that caused the adoption of pressurized irrigation systems. This study showed that a great majority of the hazelnut farmers (72.3%) used no irrigation, 24% used furrow irrigation, and 3.6% adopted the pressured irrigation systems. This study found significant differences between the irrigation groups regarding the socio-economic variables of age, education, and farming experience. However, the income level of adopters was significantly lower than non-adopters, indicating that they were searching for new ways to increase their income. Although pressured irrigation systems increase the yield of any commodity and provide economical use of water sources, this idea was not the common belief of farmers since the adoption ratio was relatively low. Pressured irrigation systems also decrease the blue water footprint and are important in protecting environmental resources. Future research must be conducted to determine the effects of irrigation, particularly the pressured irrigation systems on hazelnut yield, and extension activities must be designed accordingly. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Der/die Autor(en), exklusiv lizenziert an Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland, ein Teil von Springer Nature.","Environment; Footprint calculation; Hazelnut orchard; Sustainability; Türkiye",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139740920

Bast fibres, as the notable natural fibres, are gathered from the outer cell layers of the stem of plant. Mature and young bast fibres from two species of Sesamum, namely Sesamum indicum L. and S. radiatum Schumach. &amp; Thonn. were extracted through traditional water retting technique and analyzed for their physical, mechanical and chemical attributes. Anatomical studies revealed polygon shaped phloem (bast fibre) cells with small lumen were similar to jute, in terms of architecture, and bagasse, in terms of lumen size. Upon extraction and subsequent drying, the young stems of S. radiatum were found to yield more bast fibres by mass compared with the rest of the Sesamum samples, that was, 0.59 g (dry weight) of bast fibres from 100 g (fresh weight) of stem. According to stereo microscopic images, the mature S. radiatum fibres had rougher edges than the rest. Both S. indicum and S. radiatum fibre surfaces also seemed to have pores, according to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The porosity appeared to get more pronounced as the plants got older. The Sesamum bast fibres were also found to be extremely hydrophilic with a high-water retention value. The fibres obtained from S. radiatum were determined to be suitable for the textile industry due to their light colour, ideal diameter and length, and water-holding capacity that matched the requirements of fabric manufacturing. Even in the absence of a mordant, the mature fibres showed a significant degree and evenness of Alizarin dye attachment, which might be correlated to the increase in fibre surface roughness with fibre maturity. These fibres were also discovered to be comparable with jute in terms of phloem cell shape (polygonal), diameter (13–15 m), tenacity (12.86–32.54 gf/(g·km–1)), and linear density (2.5–3.3 g/km).

Hence, we studied the soil C and N pools and their sensitivity indices as influenced by a different combination of farmyard manure, vermicompost, biofertilisers, and crop residue of rice, wheat, and mungbean, under long-term rice-wheat-mungbean (RWMCS) and rice-wheat (RWCS) cropping systems in an Inceptisol of India. Total soil organic C increased by 78% and 104% for RWMCS and 94% and 123% for RWCS with FYM + crop residue + biofertilisers and vermicompost + crop residue + biofertilisers, respectively over unfertilised control plots of RWMCS. The highly labile C and microbial biomass C were highly sensitive to management practices compared to total organic C and less labile C fractions. Integrated application of manures and crop residues in FYM + crop residue and VC + crop residue resulted in significantly higher total N, labile N, and mineral N for both cropping systems. Higher values of C and N management indexes were observed with FYM + crop residue + biofertilisers and VC + crop residue + biofertiliser in both cropping systems than other treatments. Integrated use of organic sources had higher N fractions than the unfertilised control plots, indicating that long-term conjoint use of organics, crop residues, and biofertilisers could sustain crop production and soil quality. © 2022 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

However, its productivity and environmental friendliness remain unclear. Field observations were conducted using maize variety Pioneer 335 to evaluate the effects of Bio film mulching on soil hydrothermal status, carbon sequestration, and water productivity in a semiarid site of northwest China from 2016 to 2017. Six treatments were designed as (1) CK-1, ridge and furrow (RF) without mulching, (2) CK-2, conventional flat planting without mulching, (3) RFT, RF with transparent polyethylene film mulching, (4) RFB, RF with black polyethylene mulching, (5) RFS, RF with wheat straw mulching, and (6) RFBIO, RF with Bio film mulching. The results indicated the growth prophase of maize from sowing to silking stage received 160 mm of rainfall in cool and wet 2016, but decreased to 119.8 mm in warm and dry 2017. Bio film degradation was advanced at the mid stages of maize growth by 10 days in 2017 compared with 2016. Similarly to RFT, RFBIO significantly improved soil hydrothermal conditions compared with RFS, CK-1, and CK-2; however, its magnitude decreased at the maturity stage (P < 0.05). Both RFT and RFB had significantly higher grain yields, economic benefits and water use efficiencies than RFBIO and RFS did across two growing seasons (P < 0.05). RFBIO led to a steady improvement in soil organic carbon, light fraction organic carbon, and carbon to nitrogen ratio, which were better than those of RFT. Therefore, Bio film mulching might be environmentally friendly but not highly productive. © 2022 American Chemical Society.","biodegradable film; climatic pattern; polythene film; productivity and profitability; semiarid area; soil organic carbon",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139728773

South America (SA) is one of the main grain and protein producers in the world but the status of DA in the region is unknown. A systematic review and case studies from Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile were conducted to address the following objectives: (1) quantify adoption of existing DA technologies, (2) identify limitations for DA adoption; and (3) summarise existing metrics to benchmark DA benefits. Level of DA adoption was led by Brazil and Argentina followed by Uruguay and at a slower rate, Chile. GPS guidance systems, mapping tools, mobile apps and remote sensing were the most adopted DA technologies in SA. The most reported limitations to adoption were technology cost, lack of training, limited number of companies providing services, and unclear benefits from DA. Across the case studies, there was no clear definition of DA. To mitigate some of these limitations, our findings suggest the need for a DA educational curriculum that can fulfill the demand for job skills such as data processing, analysis and interpretation. Regional efforts are needed to standardise these metrics. This will allow stakeholders to design targeted initiatives to promote DA towards sustainability of food production in the region. © 2022 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

Methods: In total, one hundred lactating Barki and Rahmani ewes (50 ewes per breed) were used for six consecutive parities to investigate the effects of breed, parity, week of lactation, and their interactions on milk yield and composition, including percentages of milk fat and milk protein, fat-protein ratio, energy-corrected milk, milk energy value, energy balance, some serum metabolites and reproductive traits. Milk and blood samples were collected weekly throughout the study. Key results: Rahmani ewes had higher milk fat %, fat yield, protein %, protein yield and milk energy value, but lower fat-protein ratio than did Barki ewes. The greater value of energy balance and accumulated negative energy balance from parturition to energy balance equilibrium and fewer days from lambing to energy balance equilibrium were observed in Rahmani than in Barki ewes. Greater values of serum concentrations of total protein, albumin, cholesterol and lower values of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were recorded in Rahmani than in Barki ewes. Reproductive traits, including days to the first oestrus and days to conception, recorded greater values in Barki than in Rahmani ewes. Conclusion: Rahmani ewes possessed adaptive characteristics to the challenge of lactation, expressed as a lower value of fat-protein ratio, which indicated a tendency of energy balance stabilisation, than did Barki ewes. This tendency was reflected in improved reproductive traits by reducing days to first oestrus and days to conception in Rahmani compared with Barki ewes. Implications: Lactation presents a critical stressful period in the dam productive life because of the high nutritional and other managerial requirements necessary for milk production. This study was conducted to assess and compare the sustainability of the two sheep breeds to the production expenditure during lactation. © 2022 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

Findings: The results provide significant evidence that the integration of S-ERP systems and LM practices implementation improve sustainability performance. However, there is no significant evidence that S-ERP adoption contributes to the success of LM practices implementation. Research limitations/implications: Because of the chosen research approach, this study is limited to use of a laboratory experiment design. Empirical evidence based on quasi experiments on a field setting would add value to the current literature. Practical implications: Findings provide practical insights for the manufacturing sector managers into the benefits of integrating S-ERP systems and LM practices for sustainability performance improvement (e.g. reducing cost and waste, increasing operational efficiency). For ERP vendors, findings highlight how ERP vendors introduce “enablers” that incorporate LM best practices into their ERP systems and also how those vendors conform to the software sustainability criteria in the design of ERP applications. Originality/value: Contrary to previous studies that addressed the individual impact of S-ERP systems and LM practices on performance, this paper experimentally gives an indication of the impact of concurrent implementation of S-ERP and LM practices on sustainability performance, especially in developing countries. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Egypt; Emerging economies; Institutional theory; Lean manufacturing; Sustainability performance; Sustainable ERP",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139720818

Cell and gene therapies such as OTL-200 (brand name: Libmeldy) and AVXS-101 (brand name: Zolgensma) with (expected) list prices of 3.0 million EUR and 1.9 million EUR per treatment, respectively, spark a global debate on the affordability of such therapies. The aim of this study was to use a recently published cost-based pricing model to calculate prices for cell and gene therapies, with OTL-200 and AVXS-101 as case study examples. Methods: Using the pricing model proposed by Uyl-de Groot and Löwenberg, we estimated a price for both therapies. We searched the literature and online public sources to estimate (i) research and development (R&D) expenses adjusted for risk of failure and cost of capital, (ii) the eligible patient population and (iii) costs of drug manufacturing to calculate a base-case price for OTL-200 and AVXS-101. All model input parameters were varied in a stepwise, deterministic sensitivity analysis and scenario analyses to assess their impact on the calculated prices. Results: Prices for OTL-200 and AVXS-101 were estimated at 1 048 138 EUR and 380 444 EUR per treatment, respectively. In deterministic sensitivity analyses, varying R&D estimates had the greatest impact on the price for OTL-200, whereas for AVXS-101, changes in the profit margin changed the calculated price substantially. Highest prices in scenario analyses were achieved when assuming the lowest number of patients for OTL-200 and highest R&D expenses for AVXS-101. The lowest R&D expenses scenario resulted in lowest prices for either therapy. Conclusions: Our results show that, using the proposed model, prices for both OTL-200 and AVXS-101 lie substantially below the currently (proposed) list prices for both therapies. Nevertheless, the uncertainty of the used model input parameters is considerable, which translates in a wide range of estimated prices. This is mainly because of a lack of transparency from pharmaceutical companies regarding R&D expenses and the costs of drug manufacturing. Simultaneously, the disease indications for both therapies remain heavily understudied in terms of their epidemiological profile. Despite the considerable variation in the estimated prices, our results may support the public debate on value-based and cost-based pricing models, and on “fair” drug prices in general. © 2022 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy","AVXS-101; cost-based pricing; drug pricing; gene therapy; Libmeldy; OTL-200; Zolgensma",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139720753

It is shown that in a subgame perfect equilibrium of the infinitely repeated tax competition game, they simultaneously set capital taxes in every stage game when a tax union comprises similar countries with respect to productivity, whereas they may set capital taxes sequentially in every stage game when a tax union comprises dissimilar countries. This finding is significantly different from Ogawa (2013), although we also assume that capital is owned by the country's residents, as in Ogawa's model. This is because a disadvantaged member country of the tax union would suffer from larger losses when a tax union comprising dissimilar countries, and thus the tax union will choose the strategy of moving Late for the sake of sustaining tax harmonization to avoid such losses. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",,,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139717601

In this study, we developed the Irrigation Schedule and Management (ISM) model based on a simulation–optimization (Soil Water Atmosphere Plant-SWAP model with Genetic Algorithm-GA) framework. The ISM model finds an optimal combination of Irrigation Water Amount (IWA) and Irrigation Interval (II) by adjusting Water Stress (WS) responding to environmental conditions (weather, soils, crops and bottom boundary conditions) throughout growing periods. By conditioning the crop (WS) and water management (IWA and II) variables, ISM improves the sustainability of optimal crop productions under different climatic-land surface conditions. The Regional Agromet Center (RAC) site in Faisalabad (at Punjab, Pakistan) was selected to test the proposed ISM model for the field validation/synthetic numerical experiments with various crops (Wheat, Corn and Potato) and soils. We demonstrated that the ISM model that reflects the relationship between crop and water management variables improved the sustainability of crop productions and Water Productivity (WP) compared to those of the conventional irrigation method at the RAC site under various environment conditions. Additionally, the ISM-based long-term crop productions showed the variations along the yearly precipitation changes indicating that optimal combinations of the crop and water management variables are considerably influenced by environmental conditions. Although uncertainties exist, our proposed ISM model can contribute to the establishment of efficient irrigation schedule/management plans under agricultural drought. © 2022, The Author(s).","Irrigation interval; Irrigation water amount; ISM; Optimal crop production; Water productivity; Water stress","Crops; Cultivation; Drought; Genetic algorithms; Irrigation; Productivity; Soil moisture; Sustainable development; Crop production; Irrigation interval; Irrigation management; Irrigation schedule; Irrigation water amount; Irrigation waters; Optimal crop production; Water amount; Water productivity; Water stress; Water management",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139709138

The traditional measures substantially increased the related costs for enterprises to reach standards. This paper aims to develop a comprehensive cost combined environmental impact assessment method that is necessary for the analysis of wastewater treatment systems. Typical three coking wastewater treatment processes in China were evaluated. Results showed that eutrophication dominantly contributed to the overall environmental effect. Improving effluent quality could significantly reduce the total environmental impact. In terms of an economic perspective, the price of raw materials was the main factor that affected the operating cost of comprehensive treatment. Based on subsystem analysis, the pretreatment stage accounted for the majority of environmental and cost burdens, respectively reaching 64%–78% and 64%–86%. Optimizing the pretreatment process by enhancing the efficiency of high concentration raw material recovery and substituting toxic raw materials for extractant could reduce the environmental impact and economic cost by 43.8% and 57%, respectively, which was an effective way to improve the potential performance of coking wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). © 2022 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Coking wastewater treatment; Comprehensive benefits; Economic evaluation; Environmental impact; Life cycle assessment; Resource recycling","Cost benefit analysis; Economic and social effects; Effluents; Environmental impact assessments; Eutrophication; Sustainable development; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water quality; Coking wastewater treatments; Comprehensive benefit; Comprehensive costs; Economic life cycle assessment; Economics evaluations; Environmental life cycle assessment; Environmental quality; Life cycle assessment; Quality requirements; Resources recycling; Life cycle",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139708966

Therefore, the present research has examined the role of economic and environmental factors and tourism policy related to tourist arrival on the sustainability of tourism growth in China. The economic factor includes the gross domestic product (GDP), national income, and foreign direct investment (FDI), while environmental factors include carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, and nitrous oxide emission. The study has extracted the data from World Development Indicators (WDI) from 1990 to 2020. The present research has employed nonlinear autoregressive distributed lagged (NARDL) to check the linkage among variables. The current study also examines the unit root using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) tests. The results revealed that GDP, national income, tourism policy related to tourist arrival, and FDI have a positive linkage with the sustainability of tourism growth. The results also exposed that environmental factors such as CO2 emission, GHG emission, and nitrous oxide emission have a negative linkage with the sustainability of tourism growth. This study provides the guidelines to the relevant authorities and regulators in developing and implementing the regulators regarding the sustainability of tourism growth by promoting economic and environmental conditions and effective tourism policies in the country. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CO2 emission; Greenhouse gas emission; Gross domestic product; National income; Nitrous oxide emission; Sustainability of tourism growth; Tourism policy",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139705089

However, the rainbow trout industry is divided on whether to allocate or abolish imported trout subsidies. The elimination of such support would lead to a three-fold rise in the price of imported trout eggs (which are already more expensive than domestic trout eggs). Furthermore, the economic performance of the domestic trout supply chain over the imported trout supply chain remains yet to be clarified. The present study seeks to evaluate whether imported trout egg subsidies should be continued. Economic efficiency and network data envelopment analysis are used to evaluate the performance and role of subsidies in trout supply chains in Mazandaran, one of the largest trout farming provinces as a new case study in the aquaculture sector, in 2018. Farms that used imported trout eggs were found to have lower economic efficiency and higher dependence on import subsidies. Feed costs were identified to be the most important explanation for poor economic efficiency of trout production. Finally, the results reveal that the development of domestic trout propagation supply chains with integrated forward vertical structures could improve efficiency in the system. The re-distribution of imported trout egg subsidies to fund feed cost reduction technologies could provide effective solutions to enhance economic efficiency, production sustainability and food security. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.","efficiency; imported eggs subsidies; Mazandaran province; network DEA; trout supply chains",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139704077

With the demand for high safety, the replacement of traditional organic electrolytes with polymer electrolytes can avoid electrolyte leakage and thermal instability. Polymer electrolytes, however, suffer from low ionic conductivity and large interfacial impedance. Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) represent an excellent balance that combines the advantages of high ionic conductivity, low interfacial impedance, high thermal stability, and flexibility. This short review summarizes the recent progress on gel polymer Na-ion batteries, focusing on different preparation approaches and the resultant physical and electrochemical properties. Reasons for the differences in ionic conductivity, mechanical properties, interfacial properties, and thermal stability are discussed at the molecular level.

Thanks to the popularity of heavily hopped ‘India Pale Ale’-style beers, there is an increased demand from brewers for strains that can boost hop aroma. Here, we explored whether hybridization could be used to construct strains with an enhanced ability to release hop-derived flavours through β-lyase activity, which releases desirable volatile thiols. Wild Saccharomyces strains were shown to possess high β-lyase activity compared to brewing strains, however, they also produced phenolic off-flavours (POF) and showed poor attenuation. To overcome these limitations, interspecies hybrids were constructed by crossing pairs of one of three brewing and one of three wild Saccharomyces strains (S. uvarum and S. eubayanus). Hybrids were screened for fermentation ability and β-lyase activity, and selected hybrids showed improved fermentation and formation of both volatile thiols (4MMP, 3MH and 3MH-acetate) and aroma-active esters compared to the parent strains. Undesirable traits (e.g. POF) could be removed from the hybrid by sporulation. To conclude, it was possible to boost the release of desirable hop-derived thiols in brewing yeast by hybridization with wild yeast. This allows production of beer with boosted hop aroma with less hops (thus improving sustainability issues). © 2022, The Author(s).","Beta-lyase; Breeding; Brewing; Hybrid; Strain development; Thiol","Brewing; Fermentation; Odors; Yeast; Beta-lyase; Breeding; Brewing; Brewing yeast; Hybrid; Hybridisation; Lyase activity; Saccharomyces; Strain development; Thiol; Beer",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139702023

Methods: This retrospective longitudinal study utilised 1,065 twins with a recent history of LBP from the Washington State Twin Registry. A lifestyle behaviour score was built using variables of body mass index, physical activity engagement, sleep quality, smoking status, and alcohol consumption. An emotional health score was built using variables of the absence of depressed mood, perceived stress, and active coping. The main outcome was LBP resilience, assessed as recovery (“bouncing back”), and sustainability (maintaining high levels of function despite LBP). Results: After adjusting for covariates, there was no relationship between the lifestyle behaviour score (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97–1.15, p = 0.218) and the emotional health score (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.98–1.19, p = 0.142) with the likelihood of recovering from LBP. There was however, evidence of a positive association between the lifestyle behaviour score (β 0.20, 95% CI 0.04–0.36, p = 0.013), the emotional health score (β 0.22, 95% CI 0.00–0.43, p = 0.049), and greater levels of sustainability. These results were confirmed by a within-pair analysis (lifestyle behaviour score: β 1.79, 95% CI 0.05–3.53, p = 0.043) and (emotional health score: β 0.52, 95% CI 0.09–0.96, p = 0.021) adjusting for genetic and early shared environmental confounding. Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest that people who adopt optimal lifestyle behaviours and positive emotional factors are more likely to be resilient and maintain high levels of function despite suffering from LBP. © 2022, The Author(s).","Lifestyle behaviours; Low back pain; Positive; Resilience",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139698977

The purpose of this study is to examine factors contributing to hotels’ participation in TripAdvisor’s GreenLeaders program. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 48,064 hotels from 328 destinations in 29 countries, the authors leverage a multi-level logit model to examine antecedents of GreenLeaders participation. A multi-level ordered logit model is then estimated to uncover factors influencing the ranking of this participation. Findings: Empirical results indicate that hotels with a larger size, a higher class, a better online reputation, greater reliance on business travelers, fewer neighboring hotels and a more long-term-oriented culture are more apt to join the program. Online reputation factors, hotel size and the number of neighboring hotels explain GreenLeaders hotels’ rankings. A series of robustness checks reinforces the results. Practical implications: The results shed light on green program design and promotion. These findings can help hotel practitioners identify ideal target markets and better use their organizational resources to establish green programs. Several strategies can be implemented to promote hotels’ commitment to sustainability and to encourage guests’ awareness of and involvement in green practices.

However, agricultural expansion is the primary driver of biodiversity loss, particularly in the tropics where crop production is increasing and intensifying rapidly to meet a growing global food demand. It is therefore crucial to ask, how do different crops and crop production systems impact biodiversity? We first use the FAO database of harvested crop area to explore temporal changes in crop area and intensification across the entire tropical realm. We show that the harvested area of tropical crops has more than doubled since 1961, with ever-increasing intensification. The harvested area in 2019 was 7.21 million km2, equivalent to 5.5% of global ice-free land area, or 11.5% of land area in the tropics. Second, we conducted a meta-analysis of 194 studies and 1364 pairwise comparisons to assess the impact of tropical agriculture on biodiversity, comparing biodiversity values in food crop sites versus natural reference habitats. Our meta-analysis shows that crop type, rotation time and level of shading are important determinants of biodiversity assemblages. Perennial tropical crops that are grown in shaded plantations or agroforests (e.g. banana and coffee) support higher biodiversity, while crops cultivated in unshaded and often homogeneous croplands (e.g. maize, sugarcane and oil palm), and particularly annual crops, have impoverished biodiversity communities. Policy implications. Our findings highlight the increasing agricultural expansion and intensification over the last 60 years and inform our understanding of how different crops and crop production systems impact biodiversity.

In recent decades, it has become a major problem for the entire human race. Therefore, the present research evaluates the impact of oil consumption, hydro energy use, population density, and economic growth on ecological footprint in Turkey for the period from 1965QI to 2018Q4. This paper uses the BDS test to assess the nonlinearity of the variables in the pre-estimation analysis. The results of the test reveal that non-linearity occurs in all of the variables used in this study. As a consequence, using traditional linear methodologies would produce erroneous results. Our research uses the quantile techniques (quantile cointegration, quantile causality, quantile-on-quantile regression), which are recently developed nonlinear estimate methodologies to assess these associations. The results from the study reveal that oil consumption, hydro energy use, population density, and economic growth contribute to environmental degradation in Turkey in majority of the quantiles. The Granger Causality in Quantiles result also gives credence to the results. The study proposes policy recommendation based on these results. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ecological Footprint; Economic growth; Hydro energy; Oil consumption; Population density",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139688483

Yet, data on the mechanism of yield sustainability response to manure substitution is limited. We quantitatively studied yield sustainability through soil nutrients’ stoichiometry, carbon (C) sequestration, and apparent phosphorus (P) balance in a 35-year long-term trial under double rice cropping pattern in Southern China. The study consisted of five treatments: CK (control), NPK (chemical nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers), NPKM1 (30% manure; 70% chemical NPK fertilizers), NPKM2 (50% manure; 50% chemical NPK fertilizers), and NPKM3 (70% manure; 30% chemical NPK fertilizers). The combined treatments increased yield trend, sustainability index (SYI), C sequestration, P uptake, and sensitivity index, but had little effect on the coefficient of variation of the crop yield compared with the NPK treatment. The apparent P balance in fertilizer treatments has exceeded the environmental risk threshold of 35 kg ha−1 year−1. The path analysis showed that soil organic carbon (SOC) directly affected total P (TP), while SOC and TP indirectly affected yield by directly changing soil C:N:P stoichiometry. The critical values of C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios above which SYI declined were 10.8, 23.0, and 1.7, respectively. We concluded that organic amendment substitution had significant effect on yield sustainability and C sequestration, functioned as a C-sink, and revealed potential for P buildup. Therefore, substitution of chemical fertilizers by manure should be done with caution to avert excess P accumulation and loss to the environment. Also, the critical values of soil C:N:P stoichiometric ratios should be taken into cognizance during paddy soil management. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.","Apparent phosphorus balance; Carbon sequestration; Manure; Paddy rice; Sustainable yield index",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139687372

The goal of this study is to evaluate the energy potential of animal droppings from the Adamawa region of Cameroon and to predict suitable thermal conversion technologies. Structural, proximate analyses, and higher heating value (HHV) were determined experimentally, while ultimate analysis, higher heating value and flue gases were modeled from structural and proximate analyses. This study reveals that animal droppings are estimated at 3,292 972 tons of dry bone per year with cattle droppings being the most dominant. Their theoretical energy potential ranges from 48GJ/year to 58GJ/year against 46GJ/year for the experimental energy potential of combustion energy. The average absolute errors (AAE) are 4% and 6% for energy potential from ultimate and proximate analyses, respectively. These AAE are negligible and can justify the reliability of theoretical estimation of energy potential from proximate and ultimate analyses. Results also showed that flue gas released does not have a negative impact on the environment as the values are within admissible limits, and the pollutant emissions are below the regulated threshold values. The animal droppings properties studied show that they can be efficiently used in thermal conversion processes such as pyrolysis, gasification, and biogas as well as catalysts in the thermal conversion technologies. This could produce 7.81 × 108 Nm3/year and 7.70 × 105 m3/year, for annual syngas and methane, respectively. Nevertheless, the levels of S and N could be taken into account in the design of a gasification plant to control the emission of NO2 and SOx-derived pollutants as their values are more than 0.2% and 0.6%, respectively. These droppings can be used as alternative energy sources as they are highly available and can improve environmental sustainability. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Animal droppings; Biogas; Gasification; Pyrolysis; Thermal characterization","Animals; Biogas; Calorific value; Flue gases; Flues; Gas emissions; Gasification; Pollution; Sustainable development; Animal dropping; Average absolute error; Cameroon; Conversion technology; Energy-potentials; Higher heating value; Proximate analysis; Thermal characterization; Thermal conversion; Ultimate analysis; Pyrolysis",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139681038

In the past few decades, the Chinese government has realized that rapid economic development has brought about environmental pollution issues. Therefore, during the 12th and 13th Five-Year Plan period (2011–2015 and 2016–2020), a series of objectives and tasks on improving the quality of the atmosphere, water, soil, and ecological environment have been formulated by the Chinese government, which made solid progress. Based on the entropy weight TOPSIS (technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution) method and the coupling and coordination degree model (CCD model), this paper selected 14 indicators of the ecological environment and the economic system to evaluate the coordinate development of 30 provinces in China (except Tibet) from 2013 to 2019. The results show that in the past few years, the coordinated development in most regions has continued to improve, but still maintained in the transitional state of coordinated development, because the current effectiveness of China’s battle against pollution is not stable, and the industrial structure dominated by heavy industry and chemical industry, and the energy structure dominated by coal have not fundamentally changed. Based on this conclusion, we provided some suggestions for the national and provincial institutes to reduce pollutants and carbon emissions, and continuously improve the quality of the ecological environment by adhering to the strategy of green and low-carbon development. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Coupling coordination degree model; Ecological environment quality; Province sustainability; Rare indicators; Social economy","Carbon; Chemical industry; Coal industry; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Industrial economics; Pollution; Chinese Government; Coordination degree; Coupling coordination degree model; Ecological environment quality; Ecological environments; Economic development; Environment quality; Province sustainability; Rare indicator; Social economy; Sustainable development",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139678795

However, ammonium-ion storage is still in its infancy in the absence of reliable electrode materials. Here, defective VO2 (d-VO) is employed as an anode material for ammonium-ion batteries with a moderate transport pathway and high reversible capacity of ≈200 mAh g−1. Notably, an anisotropic or anisotropic behavior of structural change of d-VO between c-axis and ab planes depends on the state of charge (SOC). Compared with potassium-ion storage, ammonium-ion storage delivers a higher diffusion coefficient and better electrochemical performance. A full cell is further fabricated by d-VO anode and MnO2 cathode, which delivers a high energy density of 96 Wh kg−1 (based on the mass of VO2), and a peak energy density of 3254 W kg−1. In addition, capacity retention of 70% can be obtained after 10 000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1. What's more, the resultant quasi-solid-state MnO2//d-VO full cell based on hydrogel electrolyte also delivers high safety and decent electrochemical performance.

Despite the significant growth of publications exploring sustainable tourism, the debate on the relationship between tourism and sustainability remains open. In addition, the sector faces the challenge of the 2030 Agenda, as the authors have not yet managed to curb environmental degradation and social disparities. This research needs to be comprehensively addressed to inform future steps and to identify sustainable tourism practices that will advance the goals of this action plan. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies a mixed methodology, using a bibliometric analysis performed by VOSviewer and SciMat software of 311 articles from the Web of Science. In addition, it includes an in-depth analysis of trending research topics in the field during 2019 and 2020. Findings: After 20 years of research on sustainable tourism, there is still significant dispersion of studied topics, frameworks and applications. The results show the evolution of research towards the study and measurement of sustainable change, social and cultural aspects and the development of responsible governance models. Research limitations/implications: New stakeholder relationships models require a methodological and technological framework. Further progress in sustainable tourism guided by the 2030 Agenda demands the establishment of worldwide recognised measurement indicators and policy frameworks. Originality/value: With a mixed methodological approach and a special focus on the sustainable development goals (SDGs), this paper provides a “state-of-the-art” update to sustainability research in tourism.

Exploring the precise relationship between them can provide a theoretical dimension to the long-term development of firms and the achievement of national sustainable development goals (SDGs). In this study, the authors apply the recently developed methods to test the economic significance of Chinese firms' sustainable strategies. Specifically, the authors first adopted the ESG score constructed for corporate environmental sustainability management (ESGEnv) as a proxy variable for corporate sustainability strategies and the firms' stock returns as a proxy for corporate economic effects to investigate the economic significance of firms' strategies for sustainable development. The study then confirmed that there has a positive relationship between ESGEnv and the future stock return of firms in general. Finally, the study concluded that ESGEnv can be explained by stochastic volatility, jump risk, short selling restrictions, and arbitrage risk. Furthermore, the robustness tests based on subsample and scenario grouping analysis confirmed the inconsistency in the relationship between the economic returns for the firms and the firms' green practices based their sustainable development strategies. As a result, the study contributed the literatures by clarifying the circumstances in which the firms' sustainable development strategies do have positive impacts on their economic benefits and also by providing the academy even more fuel to the already fierce debates over the firms' economic significances because of their green practices. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","economic significance; sustainability; sustainable strategies; “green” practices",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139665027

In this essence, the literature has discerned many macroeconomic factors that are causing environmental degradation. Among others, the economic policy uncertainty (EPU) is another factor that can uplift CO2 emissions but was ignored in contemporary literature. Given that, the current analysis tends to uncover the role of EPU in CO2 emissions and how political stability moderates this relationship. The empirical analysis was arranged on 20 years of financial data (2000–2019) of BRICS economies, and fully modified least square (FMOLS) and dynamic least square (DOLS) models were utilized to establish the empirical relationship. The empirical results reveal the significant positive impact of EPU while the negative impact of political stability on CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the moderating impact of political stability was observed in the relationship of EPU-CO2 emissions. In long run, the higher economic policy uncertainty intensifies the emissions of CO2 which can be reduced by promoting political stability. The empirical analysis further advocates the dynamic impact of financial development, foreign investment, economic growth, and resource rent on pollution emissions. The moderating role of political stability implies that policy officials should certainly improve the stability of political conditions within a country. Moreover, they should ensure the overall consistency in economic policies. This study allures existing literature by exploring the moderating role of political stability in EPU and CO2 emissions nexus. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","BRICS; CO2 emissions; Economic policy uncertainty; Environmental degradation; Political stability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139655935

However, attracting top talents for key positions is meaningless if it is not backed by winning retention or succession strategies. This paper aims to assess succession management techniques in the Nzema East District (NED) of Ghana to determine incumbent reliability on its own succession knowledge, practice and sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: Through a cross-organizational investigation, this study used qualitative approaches to explore succession knowledge and practice as they relate to effective management and sustainability of selected NED organizations. In all, 60 purposively selected participants were involved in the study. Findings: This study revealed not only that most NED organizational leaders have no succession plans but also that some senior management officials of these organizations, much as their subordinates, lack knowledge and practice of the concept altogether. It also emerged that a leadership succession paradox, where management expressed profound interest in succession planning (SP) learning and practice, adopting SP as a strategic tool and in using SP as insurance for sustainability of NED firms, but presides over the contrary, characterized much of NED management activity. Research limitations/implications: As a case study, this research is limited in terms of generalizability, but its implications are quite limitless. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in an emerging leadership succession paradox where business executives advocate what, in practice and theory, they are themselves opposed to. Contrary to the logic that we practice what we learn, succession management in NED organizations is not only unethical but also paradoxical.

The basic objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the impact of green–blue revolution on sustainable environment in different quantiles. Johansen co-integration test with trace and max eigenvalues determines the long-run relationship between green–blue revolution and environmental degradation in Pakistan. Using median quantile regression analysis, we find that agricultural machinery, pesticides, and aquaculture production are positive and significant factors of production-based carbon emissions with 0.49, 0.1, and 0.09 coefficient values, respectively, while fertilizers, agricultural credit, and HYV (high yield variety) seeds are not major determinants of production-based carbon emission. At the same time, high variety seeds and fertilizers enhance the agro-environmental footprint in Pakistan with 0.23 and 0.28 coefficients, respectively, by applying median quantile regression. Similarly, agricultural machinery, pesticides, agricultural credit, and aquaculture production are not the major determinants of agro-environmental footprint by using median quantile regression. However, the response of exogenous variables varies from quantile to quantile in the case of both environmental proxies.

The duct has two separate air inlets and a battery pack in the middle. All batteries are made of lithium-ion and are placed in a PCM housing in a circular shape. The (Re) of air in the duct varied between 100 and 400, and the time of transient study was 200 min. Simultaneously, a cool environment is used to resemble a domestic building. Using Design Builder software, the thermal energy (TLEY) needed for this structure was determined yearly in various seasons. The TLEY produced in the batteries is used to heat the house, and then, it is calculated what percentage of the energy required by the house can be supplied by the battery. The results of this paper clearly indicate that the maximum and average battery temperature (T-Bt) cells in the duct increase at the beginning of the process and then decrease. After this period, depending on the amount of (Re) of air in the duct, no variations in the T-Bt are detected after a specific duration. The fixed duration of the battery temperature grew as the (Re) level increased, while the T-Bt decreased. The outlet air temperature and the average PCM fraction of the melt also remain constant after the initial decrease, after a certain time. Increasing the (Re) rate reduces the quantity of exhaust air temperature and the PCM fraction of the melt. Thus, ideally, 13.83% of the required TLEY can be supplied from the batteries in the required seasons. © 2022, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Building; Energy consumption; Lithium-ion battery; Phase change material; Sustainability of natural resources","Atmospheric temperature; Battery Pack; Ducts; Heating; Housing; Lithium-ion batteries; Phase change materials; Sustainable development; Air temperature; Battery pack; Battery temperature; Circular shape; Energy-consumption; Heating units; Lithium ions; Residential heating; Sustainability of natural resource; Transient studies; Energy utilization",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139649431

First, we establish Yuan-Sheng dialectical holism as the ontological assumption of the SRT, emphasising that the world is a ‘relation-centric’ system. Yuan refers to specific time–space relations, and the becoming of the world (Sheng) from Yuan manifests as a dialectical holistic relationship in which ‘contrary is complementary’. Second, we argue that the ontological assumption of SRT implies three methodological principles: systemhood thinking, synergistic thinking and emergent thinking. These principles focus on relations, openness, synergy, adaptation and emergence. Last but not the least, we argue that the SRT is a kind of applied systems thinking. The context-dependent multi-causation methodology, dealing with the sustainability of social-ecological systems, has been successfully applied in explaining the resilience governance of Guangzhou Haizhu Wetland in China. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","dialectical; systemism; systems thinking; Yuan-Sheng","Ontology; Context dependent; Dialectical; Guangzhou; Research traditions; Social-ecological systems; Specific time; System thinkings; Systemism; Time-space; Yuan-sheng; Systems thinking",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139649265

The paper uses an analytical study through user need finding to develop an ecofriendly carry bag–making machine targeted for livelihood generation leading to self-sustained rural and semi-urban low-income-group ecosystems. A stratified random sampling strategy and a factor-based analysis using analytical hierarchical processing (AHP) and fuzzy AHP are applied for inferential analysis to obtain factor scores of each latent variable leading to the best innovation pathway. The best grass root innovations come through the inferential analysis of responses directly gathered from the sector which is most affected. Such an innovation gets significant acceptability when the most affected strata gives direct feedback pertaining to the innovation that may lead to the creation of a sustainable livelihood ecosystem. Solution to two major practical problems, viz., (a) creating regular stable employment opportunities to people in the bottom of the pyramid and (b) reducing the pollution due to single-use plastic carry bags by providing better alternatives have been proposed through a grass root innovation approach.

The studies mainly focused on the material properties and sustainability aspects of such implementation, with little focus on the financial implications and the technical feasibility. The purpose of this research is to investigate the different lifecycle costs associated with the use of green recycled plastic lightweight aggregates (GLACs) in concrete construction in different structural systems. For that purpose, the authors evaluated a concrete structure with several variable design systems and conducted structural design once using conventional concrete and once using concrete with recycled plastic aggregates, resulting in a total of 36 distinct scenarios. The lifetime cost analysis was performed on such scenarios. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine how structural characteristics and critical element costs influence cost-effectiveness. According to the findings, this approach can save up to 6% in life-cycle expenses. The findings of this research will contribute to the upcoming paradigm shift of using recycled plastic in concrete, which will reduce the environmental impacts of both the concrete and plastic industries while also assisting developers in lowering their life cycle costs. © 2022, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.","Cost analysis; Green concrete; Life cycle cost; Modeling; Modern structural design; Optimization; Sustainability","Concrete aggregates; Cost accounting; Cost effectiveness; Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Life cycle; Light weight concrete; Sensitivity analysis; Structural analysis; Structural optimization; Sustainable development; Construction technologies; Cost analysis; Green concrete; Life cycle cost; Modeling; Modern structural design; New constructions; Optimisations; Plastics waste; Recycled plastics; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139648215

Several approaches are currently applied to assure a lower impact of diseases and higher productivity, including the exploration of the fish microbiome and its manipulation as a sustainable alternative to improve aquaculture practices. Here, using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing, we explored the microbiome of farmed seabream to assess similarities and differences among microbial assemblages associated to different tissues and compare them with those in the surrounding environment. Seabream had distinct associated microbiomes according to the tissue and compared to the marine environment. The gut hosted the most diverse microbiome; different sets of dominant ASVs characterized the environmental and fish samples. The similarity between fish and environmental microbiomes was higher in seawater than sediment (up to 7.8 times), and the highest similarity (3.9%) was observed between gill and seawater, suggesting that gills are more closely interacting with the environment. We finally analyzed the potential connections occurring among microbiomes. These connections were relatively low among the host’s tissues and, in particular, between the gut and the others fish-related microbiomes; other tissues, including skin and gills, were found to be the most connected microbiomes. Our results suggest that, in mariculture, seabream microbiomes reflect only partially those in their surrounding environment and that the host is the primary driver shaping the seabream microbiome. These data provide a step forward to understand the role of the microbiome in farmed fish and farming environments, useful to enhance disease control, fish health, and environmental sustainability. © 2022, The Author(s).","Aquaculture sustainability; Fish microbiome; Gilthead seabream; Mediterranean Sea",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139645436

New approaches may be proposed to support enterprises in identifying the appropriate strategic criteria for their sustainability initiatives, which are eventually documented in corporate sustainability reports. The present paper focuses on the food industry, particularly with regard to pasta production. The analytic hierarchy process method was used to assign relevance to sustainability criteria, according to the judgment of 10 academic experts. The initial criteria were selected from the sustainability reports of a virtuous and Italian pasta producer, La Molisana S.p.A., and divided into four categories: (1) people and community, (2) innovation and new product development, (3) commitment to the environment and (4) local supply chain and traceability. Promotion of social and economic development in the local community emerged as the most relevant criterion, followed by business development and promotion of talent. The people and community category was deemed most strategic for sustainability, while social and economic dimensions were given less relevance. Stakeholder engagement was proposed as an order winner for sustainable strategies. The present work has relevant methodological implications, as it shows that the analytic hierarchy process, applied in conjunction with a sustainability materiality matrix, may provide new and useful information for strategy and communication. In terms of operational implications, an enterprise’s historical connection to an area may attract global recognition and increase brand value through higher raw material quality, the harmonisation of human and natural resources, and synergy with the tourism industry. © 2022, The Author(s).","AHP; Food; People and community; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainability reporting",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139644934

In particular, the research question of this study is: How do the challenges faced by startups affect business models for sustainability in the context of an emerging country? Design/methodology/approach: Startups are increasingly incorporating ways to thrive in a competitive environment with innovative sustainable business models, a key factor for competitive advantage and corporate sustainability. This paper analyses startups’ challenges in adopting business models for sustainability through a case study in two startups, using the sustainable value exchange matrix (SVEM) tool through workshops, to carry out the diagnosis of these challenges. Findings: The barriers and challenges of business models for sustainability in startups were found in different categories, where the main barriers are linked to the institutional category, the organizational and the market and sales culture. Thus, the authors concluded that there is a need to reformulate public policies and to have greater participation of the actors involved. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of the research is the number of case studies (only two), which makes it difficult to generalize the results. Practical implications: The research presents two major contributions. First, through the case studies, it is possible to verify that the barriers and challenges in business models for sustainability have relevance for startups. The second contribution is the adaptation of SVEM in conducting the debate by incorporating the barriers and challenges in value creation and delivery system. Social implications: This study contributes to the business models for sustainability literature to better understand the challenges startups face in practice and can serve as insights to help overcome them. As this is an empirical study, the information gathered can help create metrics and public policies to achieve the United Nations sustainable development goals. Originality/value: The present research has as originality the analysis of the challenges in startups in implementing business models for sustainability and their relationships with the value proposition, capture and creation, as well as and delivery (adapted to the challenges found in the literature) applying the SVEM tool proposed by Morioka et al.

Although breadfruit thrives in Hawai‘i, as it has since before European contact, efforts to introduce breadfruit to the mainland United States have been challenged by the tree’s intolerance for even mildly cold temperatures. Historically, only extreme southern Florida has been consistently warm enough to support breadfruit cultivation. Today, however, likely owing to warming temperatures associated with global climate change, but possibly also the selection of breadfruit varieties with improved cold tolerance, an increasing number of growers based throughout Florida are finding success cultivating breadfruit trees and producing fruit.

The contribution of this paper is to propose a multi-objective dynamic differential game that can determine the optimal tax rate (OTR), optimal trading quantity of water (OTQW) in each province, and optimal bargain price (OBP) to balance resource consumption, economic development and environmental protection. Considering the sustainability of the ecological environment, the quantification of negative sewage value and net carbon emission constraints are introduced into the water allocation. To maximize the target revenue functions, minimize the net carbon emission constraints and obtain sustainable equilibrium solutions in this triple-level game, the costate function, Hamiltonian, and Lagrangian multiplier method are introduced. Then, a water dispatching structure is constructed for error correction between the predicted and actual runoff of the YRB.

A comprehensive environmental assessment of EFB biorefineries is critical for determining their sustainability in parallel with the bioeconomy policy. Nonetheless, no life cycle assessment (LCA) has been performed on co-producing food and biochemicals (furfural and glucose) derived from EFB biomass. This research is the first to evaluate the environmental performance of the furfural and glucose co-production processes from EFB biomass. Environmental analysis is conducted using a prospective gate-to-gate LCA for four impact categories, including global warming potential (GWP), acidification (ADP), eutrophication (EP), and human toxicity (HT). Aspen Plus is used to simulate the co-production process of furfural and glucose as well as generate mass and energy balances for LCA inventory data usage. The findings suggest that the environmental footprint in respect of GWP, ADP, EP, and HT is 4846.85 kg CO2 equivalent per ton EFB, 7.24 kg SO2 equivalent per ton EFB, 1.52 kg PO4 equivalent per ton EFB, and 2.62E-05 kg 1,4-DB equivalent per ton EFB, respectively. The normalized overall impact scores for GWP, ADP, EP, and HT are 1.16E-10, 2.28E-11, 6.12E-10, and 2.18E-17 years/ton of EFB, respectively. In summary, the proposed integrated plant is not only economically profitable but also environmentally sustainable. In the attempt to enhance the Malaysian economic sector based on the EFB, this study has the potential to serve as an indicator of the environmental sustainability of the palm oil industry.

This recycling is often unregulated and rudimentary, and takes place in urban settings where it can cause direct exposure of the surrounding human populace. E-waste is often burnt at low temperatures, resulting in both organic and inorganic contamination. This study set out to investigate the extent of contamination at two locations within an urban Ghanaian e-waste recycling centre by assessing the residual impact of activities in soils. Comparison of e-waste soil potential toxic element (PTE) concentrations to those in Ghanaian baseline and mine spoil soils showed considerably greater contamination from e-waste. Generally, PTE concentrations increased in the order: baseline soils < mine spoil soils < e-waste soils, except in the case of lead (Pb) where baseline and mine spoil soils switched positions. At median concentrations, cobalt enrichment was 2- to 4-fold higher in the e-waste soils than in mine spoil soils, while arsenic was 3- to 5-fold higher. With reference to the baseline soils, manganese, nickel and bismuth concentrations were, respectively, up to 4-, 11- and 53-fold higher in the e-waste soils. Median cadmium, zinc, copper and Pb concentrations were, respectively, up to 170-, 213-, 231- and 263-fold higher in the e-waste soils compared to the mine spoil soils. The human exposure implications of e-waste burning are discussed along with policy recommendations aimed at ensuring the social and environmental sustainability of e-waste recycling. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","E-waste; Environmental sustainability; Potential toxic element; Soil contamination",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139628768

Madder is an input (dyestuff) that can be used instead of hazardous chemicals in textile dyeing. With this feature, madder has a high trade potential. It has been cultivated and traded throughout history. Although it came to the point of disappearance after the discovery of synthetic dyes, it has gained significance again today. The study aimed to support, the commercial value of madder with figures. In this study, the commercial value of madder emphasized with figures. Madder is a driving force that carries economies from rural development to national development and it is a material compatible with sustainability goals. It has been frequently preferred in textile coloring in recent years because it supports zero discharge of hazardous chemicals. At the empirical stage of the study, the amount of fabric to be dyed with a unit of madder was calculated by multiplying the product obtained per hectare with the dyestuff ratio. Then, the average of the prices of madder obtained from various producers was collected and the commercial value of the madder was revealed.

The structure and composition of the synthesized catalyst were characterized by FT-IR, XRD, EDX, SEM, TEM, TGA, and VSM techniques. Structural characterization of the newly synthesized adsorbent confirmed the modification of magnetic nanoparticles by dendrimer molecules. The adsorption performance of this novel dendritic nanomaterial was evaluated for the removal of heavy metal contaminants with sustainability concerns. The effect of essential parameters, including pH, initial metal ion concentration, adsorbent dosage, and contact time was investigated. The prepared adsorbent showed good binding ability with Pb(II) and Cd(II) metal ions and excellent adsorption efficiency toward these contaminants from aqueous media (93.6%, 98.5%). The heavy metal ions could be adsorbed by coordination to the hydroxyl and amine functional groups of ethanolamine moiety and also triazine amine groups and electrostatic interactions.

Through this research perspective and an exploratory multiple case study (holistic), the authors assess the implications related to the concept of biodiversity and the impacts that organizational choices could have on the consideration and management of this complex concept. Findings: The desire of these entrepreneurs to change their ways of doing things and try to produce in a way that respects the ecosystem and enhances natural genetic diversity, while simultaneously drawing value from it in a healthy and sustainable manner, is evident. The orientation toward a sustainable and ecologically innovative business brings the concept of profit into the background on several occasions, leading these bakery entrepreneurs to be visionary green entrepreneurs (or ecopreneurs). The desire to be sustainable and to change the ways of “business as usual” makes these companies and their entrepreneurs an example of “sustainability-as-flourishing.” Originality/value: By adopting the systems thinking approach and multiple case studies, this study examines the interrelation between some innovative small companies (bakeries) and biodiversity, their motivations to actively engage in biodiversity protection and their roles in protecting agrobiodiversity as well as the natural wealth of the ecosystem. © 2022, Riccardo Torelli and Federica Balluchi.","Agrobiodiversity; Biodiversity; Case study; Ecosystem; Systems thinking",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139622568

Unlike extant studies, this study focuses on the effects of renewable energy consumption on the economic progress of the Nordic countries including Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Iceland. The empirical analysis encompasses two distinctive renewable energy consumption indicators while accounting for influential factors like research and development (R&D) expenditures, and both human and physical capital components within the traditional growth model framework. The DCCE estimator was deployed for the empirical analysis covering the available sample data between 1995 and 2020. From the results, the estimated impact of renewable energy consumption on economic progress varies according to its measurement vis-à-vis the utilized indicator 1 (renewable as % of total energy use) and indicator 2 (distinctive renewable power sources and biofuels). In the case of the former indicator, the impacts were insignificant while a positive significant impact on growth was seen across all model evaluations using both the GDP and per capita income levels of the Nordic countries in the latter indicator. Furthermore, both R&D expenditures and human capital component are essential significant long-run drivers of both economic growth and income levels in the bloc while physical capital formation produced contrary evidence on economic progress in the bloc. As such, policy implications and recommendations to enhance economic progress were suggested in the main text for the Nordic countries in view of renewable energy development and the bloc’s environmental sustainability drive. Notably, strategic policy implementation should be geared towards encouraging more R&D expenditures, especially in renewable energy developments to facilitate economic growth and income levels while further positioning the Nordic bloc on environmental sustainability path. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Economic growth; Environment; Nordic countries; R&D expenditures; Renewable energy",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139621792

Unfortunately, using such massive batteries to alleviate range anxiety is ineffective for mainstream EV adoption owing to the limited raw resource supply and prohibitively high cost. Ten-minute fast charging enables downsizing of EV batteries for both affordability and sustainability, without causing range anxiety. However, fast charging of energy-dense batteries (more than 250 Wh kg−1 or higher than 4 mAh cm−2) remains a great challenge3,4. Here we combine a material-agnostic approach based on asymmetric temperature modulation with a thermally stable dual-salt electrolyte to achieve charging of a 265 Wh kg−1 battery to 75% (or 70%) state of charge in 12 (or 11) minutes for more than 900 (or 2,000) cycles. This is equivalent to a half million mile range in which every charge is a fast charge. Further, we build a digital twin of such a battery pack to assess its cooling and safety and demonstrate that thermally modulated 4C charging only requires air convection. This offers a compact and intrinsically safe route to cell-to-pack development. The rapid thermal modulation method to yield highly active electrochemical interfaces only during fast charging has important potential to realize both stability and fast charging of next-generation materials, including anodes like silicon and lithium metal. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139620318

In contrast to established LIBs, SIBs are an emerging technology in an early stage of development where a challenge is to identify the most promising and sustainable cathode active materials (CAM) for further research and potential commercialization. Thus, a comprehensive and flexible CAM screening method is developed, providing a fast and comprehensive overview of potential sustainability hotspots for supporting cathode material selection. 42 different SIB cathodes are screened and benchmarked against eight state-of-the-art LIB-cathodes. Potential impacts are quantified for the following categories: i) Cost as ten-year average; ii) Criticality, based on existing raw material criticality indicators, and iii) the life cycle carbon footprint. The results reveal that energy density is one of the most important factors in all three categories, determining the overall material demand. Most SIB CAM shows a very promising performance, obtaining better results than the LIB benchmark. Especially the Prussian Blue derivatives and the manganese-based layered oxides seem to be interesting candidates under the given prospective screening framework. © 2022 The Authors.

As Friere emphasized humans’ unique characteristic of ‘unfinishedness’ with abilities of self-reflexivity through our histories and goal-setting from our dreams, (environmental) pedagogues must teach toward deepened and widened understandings for praxis grounded in socio-environmental justice and planetary sustainability, including disrupting anthropocentricism. This ‘unfinishedness’ has made humans agents of world-Earth unsustainably and dominance in constructing the Anthropocene, but also allows for possibilities of transformation to counter them. I argue that ecopedagogy is essential in disrupting the following falsely taught ideologies that justifies the Anthroposphere: (1) false commonsense that separates environmental and social violence (i.e., socio-environmental violence) and instills anthropocentrism that separates humans from the rest of Nature (i.e., world-Earth distancing); (2) fatalism that extinguishes hope of ending humans’ acts of unsustainable environmental violence; (3) ‘development’ for sustaining hegemony and planetary unsustainability (i.e., Development rather than development); and (4) epistemological dominance that legitimizes the first three ideologies given (e.g., epistemologies of the North). © 2022 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia.","Anthropocene; Ecopedagogy; environmental pedagogy; Paulo Freire; Planetarism; socio-environmental justice",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139618084

What would happen if consumers will be asked to assess a product's attribute, i.e., packaging, in a virtual environment, instead of being able to physically hold the product, like in a traditional purchasing process? The aim of this study is to analyze consumers' evaluation of packaged products in immersive VR, manipulating packaging structural and haptic cues, and clarify potential differences with the consumers' responses in the real life. We conducted two focus groups (Study 1), with 16 participants, a mixed design experiment (Study 2), involving 167 consumers, to analyze consumers' attitudes, and a choice-based conjoint analysis (Study 3), with 41 individuals, to study actual choice behavior. The main findings reveal that consumer behavior in VR is consistent with everyday life, except for minor variations. VR proves to be an efficient and rigorous research environment, also suitable for testing sensory cues and non-tangible attributes. Finally, the article suggests managers can effectively use VR for product and packaging development, through a more sustainable process that requires fewer resources and time compared to traditional tests. © 2022 The Authors.

Their unique set of properties combined with their renewability and availability has made them much popular. Natural fibers are biodegradable, which is a standout property of its composites. Natural fibers are easily available and the fibers can be separated at lower economic rates. The handling of natural fibers is easy compared with other synthetic fibers. Plant fibers are lingo cellulosic fibers having hemicelluloses, pectin, waxes, lignin and cellulose. Natural fibers are used in various forms, such as randomly oriented, continuous etc. Lemon grass can be used as a replacement in the non-wooden industry. In research, it is observed that lemongrass has lower content of lignin and higher cellulose percentage. The thermal behaviour and the surface features and functionality of the fiber were evaluated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Due to the fibers hydrogen bonding, the structure of fiber is strong.

Design/methodology/approach: The main dataset was a sample of 120 media articles that discussed corporate conduct related to COVID-19 from both developing (Chile, Mexico and Peru) and developed (Australia, UK and the USA) countries. Concerns evident from those articles were compared and then mapped to applicable GRI standards to identify relevant disclosures and gaps. Findings were triangulated by drawing on two additional datasets: Latin American GRI-related academic literature (in Spanish) and submissions to GRI standards. Findings: Media analysis reveals significant differences between developing and developed country concerns, as well as gaps in GRI disclosure requirements in relation to customers, labour standards and corporate interactions with non-government organisations and governments. Analysis of Latin American literature corroborates the concerns raised in media articles regarding employment. Additionally, it points out country-specific issues and calls for increased reporting of corruption. Analysis of the GRI standards development process reveals marked underrepresentation of developing countries, which may contribute to the observed deficiencies in the GRI standards. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the (surprisingly rare) research concerning the quality of GRI standards and responds to calls for greater attention to developing countries in the SEA literature by showing that GRI standards may not fully meet the needs of users in the developing country context of Latin America.

This intersection is then tested by a literature review of 164 BoP SC articles between the years 2000 and 2022. Descriptive, frequency, and correlation analysis identify various risks factors studied in the BoP literature so far, their management strategies and respective performance measures. The findings show a broad strategical aspect of managing SC risks and proffered the tactical or operational level performance measures which along with these practices can manage the related risks. Therefore, their incorporation into the risk management process should be considered. The correlation findings highlight the important role of performance process measures and the impact of these along with the management practices on firm's performance outcomes.

Design/methodology/approach: In 2017 and 2018, the authors conducted13 semi-directed interviews with municipal staff and elected officials from three municipalities, a documentary analysis of primary and secondary sources. Interviews and documentation collected were also coded using the software NVIVO 12. The authors compared three municipal case studies: the City of Toronto (Ontario), the City of Guelph (Ontario), and the Town of Bridgewater (Nova Scotia). Findings: The authors found that leadership is a prominent factor explaining the expansion of municipal climate action in Canada. Municipal climate action is initiated and championed by an individual, elected officials or municipal staff, who lead and engage in the development of policy instruments to mitigate and/or adapt to climate change. These leaders facilitate the formulation and implementation of instruments, encourage a paradigm shift within the municipality, overcome structural and behavioural barriers, and foster collaboration around a common vision. Optimal municipal climate leadership occurs when the leadership of elected officials and municipal is congruent, though networks play a significant role by amplifying municipal sustainability leadership. They support staff and elected officials leadership within municipalities, provide more information and funding to grow the capacity of municipalities to develop instruments, to the point that conditions under which municipalities are driving climate action are changing. Research limitations/implications: This paper hopes to contribute to better understand under what conditions municipalities drive change. Originality/value: There is an international scholarly recognition that municipalities should be further explored and considered important actors in the Canadian and international climate change governance. Gore (2010) and Robinson and Gore (2015) highlighted that we are yet to understand the extent to which municipalities are involved in climate governance in Canada. This article directly addresses this gap in the current scholarly literature and explores the expansion of climate municipal leadership with the aspects of interviews. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Climate change; Municipalities; Policy entrepreneurs; Public leadership; Public service leadership",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139602214

The solution was transferred into a hydrogel by cross-linking using epichlorohydrin and ethanol immersion, and a chitin bioplastic was finally prepared by drying in a mold at 40 °C. The solution concentration positively impacts viscosity, crystallinity, and smoothness. A 4% chitin bioplastic exhibits high barrier properties, flame retardancy, high-temperature resistance, mechanical properties (tensile strength up to 107.1 MPa), and soil degradation properties. The chitin bioplastic can be completely degraded by microorganisms in 7 weeks. In addition, biosafety tests suggest that chitin is safe for cells and crops (wheat and mung beans). The chitin bioplastic was further applied to containers, straws, cups, and photoprotection, and it was found that the water resistance and transparency were comparable to those of commercial polypropylene plastics.

The continuously increasing demand leads to competition and conflict over limited resources. Syria, Jordan, and Israel compete over the water resources in the transboundary Yarmouk River basin where two water agreements dictate the allocation of water. The two arrangements are far from being efficient and fair while little cooperation is being made over sharing the resources that are being over-exploited. In this study, water sustainability was investigated under projected developments and trends based on the current use and allocation regime in the watershed using several scenarios. A one bucket soil moisture model was adopted and optimized in order to fully represent the ever-changing hydrology of the basin using the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) tool. Demands along with the existing water infrastructure and their operation were modelled despite the lack of many data and the huge uncertainty in some. Simulation of business as usual scenario showed that continuing with the current use cannot be sustainable in the short and long term. The growth of both agriculture and population produced huge water shortages in all demand sectors. Under climate change scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, surface water availability and the retention of dams reduced significantly. The share of Jordan from the Yarmouk River was the most vulnerable to climate change impacts. Enhancing irrigation efficiency and a more stable population growth based on the UN medium variant population projection showed improvements in water coverage within all demand sectors. Analysis of future scenarios suggests that water shortage is expected in all riparian states of the basin but can be mitigated by reducing demands. © 2022 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.","basin; Israel; Jordan; river; scenario; Syria; transboundary; water resource management; WEAP; Yarmouk",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139564203

Hydrogen (H2) is a form of environmentally friendly renewable energy with an extremely high energy density of 143 MJ kg-1. Water splitting is a practical and cost-effective approach to generate H2 through the decomposition of H2O by electrolysis with an external power supply. Herein, we introduce a compelling platform technology for self-powered water splitting by using a soft magnetoelastic generator to convert hydropower into electricity as a sustainable power supply for electrolysis. At a rotating speed of 469 rpm, the hydropower harvester is able to convert flowing kinetic energy into electricity and produce a high current density of 2.99 mA cm-2 at a low resistance of 60 ω. The magnetoelastic generator is intrinsically waterproof since the magnetic field can penetrate the water molecules. As a demonstration, the device maintained a stable electrical output even in underwater situations after over 7,000 cyclic operations. The generated electricity from hydropower could produce H2 at a rate of 1.93 × 10-3 mL min-1.

Similarly, hulls separated from pistachio are discarded as waste in food processing industries. These waste materials contain functional constituents having immense industrial and nutraceutical applications. This review article summarizes the scientific investigations regarding the functional constituents and bioactive compounds in pistachio shells (PSs) and pistachio hulls (PHs). It also highlights the nutraceutical potential exhibited by functionally active compounds as well as their potential applications in various industries including nutraceutical, medicinal, and feed industries together with biosynthetic development of useful products and wastewater treatment. Pistachio waste (PW) comprising PS and PH is a rich source of various bioactive compounds. PS is full of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose. PH is an excellent source of carbohydrates (80.64 ± 0.98%) (including glucose, galactose, rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, galacturonic acid) as well as ash (6.32 ± 0.26%) and proteins (1.80 ± 0.28%) with small amounts of fats (0.04 ± 0.005%).

We assert that this expansion was due to FE’s capacity to explain the 2008 crisis beyond its economic-financial dimensions and to analyse the effects of the political-economic austerity measures on the sustainability of life. We claim that a differentiating feature of FE in Spain is its permeability to dialogue with social movements. Therefore, it has become more politicized and critical than other academic fields. This influence has also been reflected in the structure and contents of the most recent FE national conferences, which from 2013 on included not only the classic academic strand but also training and political action strands. In order to explore this development, our methodology includes interviews with key informants; document analysis of material generated in the conferences and the Feminism Committees of 15-M; questionnaires to activists, academics, and practitioners of FE; and informal observation as direct participants of the described processes and events. The paper begins with an introduction to FE thought and its connections with so-called ‘Feminism for the 99%’ and continues with a methodological section. The twofold results section analyzes the dialogues between FE and FC-15 M. It concludes with a summary of the key ideas presented and some final remarks. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","15-M movement; feminist committee; feminist conference; Feminist economics; social movements; sustainability of life",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139556982

Several factors are discovered that are critical for energy efficiency in the region. Still, there are many economic, financial, energy, and research and development factors that could influence energy efficiency and remained ignored in the scholarly research, which is important from economic growth as well as environmental sustainability perspective. This research contributes to the existing literature by providing novel factors affecting energy efficiency in the developed nations. Specifically, the current study investigates the influence of financial inclusion, energy R&amp;D, political-economic-financial risk index, and the energy-related inflation on the energy efficiency of G7 economies covering the period from 2004 to 2020. This study employed the slope heterogeneity and cross-section dependence test, which led to using the second-generation unit root test. For empirical estimations, the current study utilizes the panel Quantile regression, and the outcomes reveal that all the considered variables positively influence the energy efficiency in the region. However, the influence of these variables increases except for the energy-related inflation when moving from lower quantile Q0.25 to medium Q0.50 to higher quantile Q0.75, respectively. The estimated results are found robust, confirmed by the FMOLS estimator. Based on the empirical findings, it is recommended that financial inclusion and energy-related research and development be enhanced to achieve the region's energy efficiency. © 2022 The Author(s).

Herein, we have developed a highly efficient, robust catalytic system consisting of a ruthenium hydride complex [RuH(CO)(dppp)(en)]Cl and tetrabutylammonium acetate (TBAOAc), where the former was employed as a catalyst for selective hydrogenation of methyl levulinate (ML) to A AŽA A³-valerolactone (GVL) with molecular hydrogen under mild reaction conditions without any base additives, while the latter was used as a low-temperature molten salt solvent assisting the hydrogenation reaction. After the reaction, solid salt TBAOAc can settle down spontaneously due to the immiscibility with weak polar extraction solvent, leading to the clean separation of products from reaction mixture. Furthermore, the catalytic system was highly leaching-resistant and maintains its catalytic activity in the consecutive recycles. Notably, TBAOAc not only acted as reaction media but also played an important role in improving the catalytic performance via the coordination of OAc- with Ru sites. In contrast to poor activity of ML hydrogenation catalyzed by Ru complex in conventional organic solvents, the superior catalytic activity was achieved by using TBAOAc as media. NMR, HR-ESI-MS analysis, and deuterium-labeling studies indicated that the ligand exchange could happen between TBAOAc and the ruthenium hydride complex via the formation of Ru-OAc species, which can promote H2 activation, dissociation and sequential hydrogenation. Finally, this catalytic system has been extended smoothly for N-formylation of a large variety of amines with carbon dioxide and hydrogen and showed high catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity toward formamides. This study identifies the reason for TBAOAc-assisted ruthenium complex catalyzing hydrogenation and provides new insights to optimize the sustainability of a procedure for the conversion of biomass-derived platform molecules and CO2. © 2022 American Chemical Society.",,"Additives; Amides; Amines; Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Hydrogen; Indicators (chemical); Ruthenium compounds; Solvents; Temperature; Atom-efficient; Catalyse; Catalytic hydrogenation; Catalytic system; Chemical intermediates; Fine Chemicals; Reductive amination of carbon dioxide; Ruthenium complexes; Ruthenium hydride complex; Tetrabutylammonium acetates; Hydrogenation",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139550254

Qualitative data were derived from government policy documents, government officials and key actors from non-state sport organisations. Matland’s Ambiguity-Conflict Model was the theoretical framework used to analyse the policy-implementation link.

Bioeconomy (BE) can contribute to sustainable development by substituting fossil-based products with renewable ones; however, sustainability is not intrinsic to BE. Methods: Therefore, we developed a holistic and integrated life cycle sustainability assessment (HILCSA) method containing 91 indicators, implemented in openLCA, using the Ecoinvent and SoCa database, and addressing 15 out of 17 Sustainable Development Goals. We applied it for the first time to show its capabilities by assessing the holistic sustainability of laminated veneer lumber (LVL) relative to hot-rolled steel beams. Results, discussion: Our results indicate that renewable bio-based construction materials can have a better holistic sustainability than fossil-based products for nearly all indicators, by less stressing the environment, having a less negative impact on society and being economically more efficient. However, fossil-based components of LVL such as phenolic resin are main contributors of negative impacts and should be reduced and replaced. Renewable resources from agriculture and forestry have significant impacts on land use (change). Conclusions: HILCSA demonstrates to be able to provide comprehensive sustainability assessments as well as aggregated results. BE substitutes indeed can improve sustainability; however, sustainability assessments and HILCSA need to be further developed to allow conclusions to be drawn about absolute sustainability of BE. © 2022, The Author(s).","Bioeconomy; Laminated veneer lumber; LCA; LCSA; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle sustainability assessment; SDGs; Sustainable development goals",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139529042

Approaching sustainability as a core paradigm of quality education in the twenty-first century, Education for Sustainable Development necessitates an integrated view on learning. For educational organizations, Whole Institution Approaches (WIAs) to sustainability emphasize that all learning is embedded within its socio-physical contexts. Although the core objective—to “walk the talk” on sustainability—is theoretically well established, questions remain regarding its specific conceptualizations. Based on a systematic qualitative analysis of 104 international documents from scientific and grey literature, this article offers a conceptual synthesis of the core elements of WIAs to sustainability in education. Based on the literature analysis, WIAs are described as continuous and participative organizational learning processes aimed at institutional coherence on sustainability, consistently linking the formal and informal (hidden) curricula. While specific pathways are necessary for diverse organizations, the article synthesizes a joint framework. Key characteristics of WIAs are clustered within five core principles (coherence, continuous learning, participation, responsibility, long-term commitment), seven highly integrated areas of action (governance, curriculum, campus, community, research, communication, capacity building), the underlying organizational culture, and critical conditions for successful implementation. As becomes clear from the synthesis, following a WIA means to collaboratively switch the default mode of all rules-in-use to sustainability. The concept of WIAs may thus both be approached as an instrument for consistent organizational development in light of (un-)sustainability and as a keystone of integrated high-quality sustainability learning. © 2022, The Author(s).","Education for sustainable development; Hidden curriculum; Institutional coherence; Sustainability; Whole institution approach; Whole school approach",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139528442

In the fisheries sector, fishery improvement projects (FIPs) aim to address environmental challenges by leveraging the capacity of industry actors and using value chains to incentivize change. Despite globally rising FIP numbers, the incentive structures behind FIP establishment and the role of internal dynamics remain poorly understood. This paper uses institutional entrepreneurship as an analytical lens to examine the institutional change surrounding the management and trade of the Indonesian blue swimming crab and sheds light on how global market dynamics, local fishery dynamics, and value chain initiatives interact to affect the trajectory towards sustainability over time. We contribute to the institutional entrepreneurship framework by extending it with social-ecological dynamics, different actors’ ability to realize or resist change, and outcomes of institutional change. These additions can improve its explanatory power in relation to sustainability initiatives in fisheries governance and beyond. Our cross-scale historical analysis of the value chain shows not only the entrepreneurship behind the FIP’s establishment, and its institutional interventions, but also why these have been unsuccessful in improving the ecological sustainability of fishers’ and traders’ behavior. This provides valuable empirical grounding to a wider debate about industry leadership and private incentives for sustainability at large and helps disentangle under what conditions such initiatives are more (or less) likely to have intended effects. © 2022, The Author(s).","Blue swimming crab; Fishery improvement projects; Institutional entrepreneurship; Market interventions; Seafood; Sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139527111

In this paper, we explore the relationship between place attachment and the ecocentric attitude of farmers engaged in Jhum cultivation (shifting cultivation or slash-and-burn cultivation) in the Zunheboto District of Nagaland, India. We administered a questionnaire survey (n = 153) based on a widely used four-dimensional place attachment framework and a well-known cognitive scale for measuring ecocentric attitude. The results indicate that Jhum farmers' modest ecocentric attitude is significantly associated with their place attachment, especially with place identity and place dependence, although their behaviour of organized deforestation is in apparent contradiction. While an ecocentric attitude generally contributes to environmentally responsible behaviour, we argue that, for Jhum farmers, the absence of such a causal relationship is influenced by other rationalities, particularly owing to the lack of alternative livelihood opportunities. The findings of this study establish the inherent positive ecocentric attitude of Jhum farmers who are often held responsible for deforestation and environmental degradation. Furthermore, we argue that such an inherent positive ecocentric attitude and a strong place attachment are imperative to implement place-based models for sustainable mountain agriculture. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","ecological restoration; environmental attitude; landscape sustainability; place-attachment; shifting cultivation","Cultivation; Surveys; Sustainable development; Alternative livelihoods; Causal relationships; Ecological restoration; Environmental attitudes; Environmentally responsible behaviours; Landscape sustainability; Place-attachment; Place-based; Questionnaire surveys; Shifting cultivations; Deforestation",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139527004

Addressing attitudes is a complex task that must ensure reflective learning approaches. Teaching strategies must facilitate a safe space to talk openly about emotions and caring responsibilities. We reflect on two training initiatives focusing on culture of care. Firstly, the ‘Care-full Stories’ tool, which uses fictionalised prompts (storytelling) to encourage participants to share their own stories from working in animal research. Feedback on its impact on establishing a safe space for sharing experiences and the importance of appreciating diverse perspectives between staff is discussed. Secondly, we provide feedback on the development of training approaches on animal research integrity and culture of care with low- middle-income international communities. Strategic targets addressing the multicultural diversity of the communities, recognising their specific needs and their access to resources, must be well defined. It is important to acknowledge the interconnection between people, animals and their shared natural environment when defining the culture of care concept and addressing the teaching approaches. We discuss both the positive outcomes and challenges of these two learning experiences to support innovation when planning tools for teaching culture of care. Accounting for ‘how’ and ‘where’ the training will be delivered remains key to its successful uptake and local sustainability. Supporting improved educational tools to ascertain why caring has an impact on our professional lives will have a direct impact on the wellbeing of laboratory animal professionals worldwide. © The Author(s) 2022.","communication; empathy; engagement; storytelling; Training","adult; article; care behavior; education program; emotion; empathy; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; middle income group; responsibility; storytelling; teaching; wellbeing",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139524393

Further, people expect their homes to meet sustainability targets and for the lifestyles they proffer to accord with low impact living. Earthship buildings are marketed as being an epitome of sustainable alternative housing. Built by reusing or repurposing mostly reclaimed urban waste products, their design includes the utilization of low embodied energy materials, passive solar heating and cooling, photovoltaic power systems, rainwater harvesting, solar hot water heating, along with black and grey water treatment systems. Thus, Earthship buildings are considered exemplars for contributions to both the sustainability and climate change agendas. This study explores stakeholder opinions of whether Earthship buildings can contribute towards the future of alternative housing in the United Kingdom (UK). Opinions were sought through questionnaire survey completed by UK members of online social media groups whose shared focus is related to sustainability (n=50). Results reveal that the public believe the main benefits are their minimal environmental impact and also their reliance on renewable energy resources; whilst the main barriers are identifying suitable building plots and obtaining the necessary planning permissions to build. Notwithstanding the participants included in this study already have an interest in sustainability issues, it is surmised that the general public deem the general principles of Earthships are an acceptable choice of alternative home/living. However, whilst the uptake of Earthship homes are proving increasing popular in some parts of the world, the upmost concern within the UK setting is the reality of finding somewhere suitable to build an Earthship and then being given the required authorisations to construct the building. Therefore, the study recommends a need for future Earthship investigations to review the bureaucratic obstacles encountered during land searches and acquisitions and, alongside this, appraise the challenges of gaining the necessary planning permissions. © 2022 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.",,"Climate change; Passive solar; Product design; Solar power generation; Surveys; Sustainable development; Waste treatment; Water treatment; Affordable housing; Building stakeholders; Embodied energy; Growing demand; Low impacts; Planning permissions; Repurposing; United kingdom; Urban wastes; Waste products; Housing",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139522591

The work used news and media articles gathered from the LexisNexis database covering 5 months between February and July 2020. The data analyses describe the general patterns in the news texts by using text mining techniques, and the methodology describes the relationship between consumer behavior, supply chain issues, and the reduced level of service shown during the study period. Demand behaviors include precautionary and opportunistic buying, which affected many countries and could be the result of a lack of perceived control and other factors; for example, near-empty shelves of certain products could have prompted consumers to increasingly look for comparable products, driving up demand. Additionally, the method explored the potential effect of strategies to mitigate impacts on the resilience of supply chains. The results confirmed that buying behaviors and a reduction in the capacity of the supply chain led to a lower level of service being perceived by consumers, however, resilience strategies were found to mitigate the impact of such capacity reductions. Empirical analyses showed that the proposed approach, using data extracted from the news, could identify and represent impacts consistent with expectations from the supply chain field under disruptions, and quantify the magnitude of the impacts as the pandemic evolved, providing more information for decision making. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2022.","freight; logistics; resilience; supply chain; sustainability","Consumer behavior; COVID-19; Data mining; Decision making; Analytic approach; Based clustering; Buying behavior; Counting data; Freight; Level of Service; Regression modelling; Resilience; Supply chain resiliences; Text analytics; Supply chains",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139521381

The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize existing research on facilitators and barriers to implementation and sustainability of nutrition and physical activity interventions in early childcare settings targeting 2–5-year-old children, including considerations for equitable implementation. This review adhered to PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Peer-reviewed literature was searched in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, and PsycINFO databases up to September 2020. Primary research studies that examined facilitators and barriers (or related synonyms) to the implementation and sustainability of nutrition and physical activity interventions in early childcare settings were eligible for inclusion. The search yielded 8092 records that were screened by four analysts in Covidence software with a final review of 24 studies. Two independent reviewers conducted study selection, data extraction, and quality appraisal (Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool). A “best fit” framework was applied using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) constructs to code barriers and facilitators. The most salient constructs were (1) “Available Resources,” which was composed of time, staffing, space, and staff trainings; (2) adaptability; and (3) compatibility, the latter two indicating that easily modifiable interventions facilitated a smoother “fit” and were more likely to be successful, given adequate site-level resources. Only nine (28%) reported the use of a theory, model, or framework to guide evaluation; six studies (24%) included factors related to sustainability; and nine studies (38%) conducted their interventions with low-income or minoritized groups. The findings point to the need for intervention evaluations examining nutrition and physical activity to more consistently consider (a) sustainability factors early on in design and adoption phases; (b) use of theory, model, or framework to guide evaluation; and (c) equity-related frameworks and considerations for how equitable implementation. © 2022, Society for Prevention Research.","Child care; Dietary intake; Health equity; Implementation science; Physical activity","adoption; child; child care; Cinahl; data extraction; dietary intake; Embase; female; health equity; human; implementation science; lowest income group; male; Medline; physical activity; practice guideline; preschool child; PsycINFO; review; software; staff training; systematic review; theoretical study",Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139519721

Reversible cycling of high-energy aqueous batteries has been showcased using highly concentrated aqueous electrolytes, which lead to a significantly suppressed water activity and formation of a stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). However, the high salt concentration inevitably raises the cost and compromises the environmental sustainability. Herein, we use layered TiS2 as a model anode to explore the feasibility of cycling aqueous cells in dilute electrolytes. By coupling three-electrode cycling data with online electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements, we depict the potential-dependent gas evolution from the cell in the absence of a stable SEI. We offer a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the complex interfacial chemistry in dilute electrolytes, taking into account material reactivity and interfacial compatibility. Design strategies and research directions of layered-type electrodes for sustainable aqueous batteries with dilute electrolytes are recommended, based on the scientific discovery presented in this work. © 2022 The Authors.

Data came from an online survey conducted in Finland and Sweden that screened for respondents who expressed a preference for living in an apartment, as compared with a low-rise dwelling. Responses were analyzed using exploratory factor and regression analyses. Swedish respondents assigned significantly higher requirements to factors related to environmental and social sustainability performance than Finnish respondents. Requirements in both countries were described across three factors: environmental and social sustainability, quality, and design. Factor scores differed between socioeconomic sub-groups, particularly regarding quality, between urban and non-urban respondents. Preferences to live in an apartment in a wooden building were positively associated with respondents’ requirements for environmental and social sustainability, and negatively with requirements for quality-related attributes. Opposite relationships were found in the Swedish sample for apartments in non-wooden structure houses. Design requirements had no significant association with preferences for a specific material in load-bearing structures for multi-story buildings, in either country. The findings can contribute toward enhanced marketing efforts and customized value propositions to increase the social acceptability of multi-story wooden buildings and advance climate-related goals within the housing sector. © 2022 The Author(s).

How can countries satisfy their demands while jointly delivering the required transformative change to achieve global sustainability targets? Here, we present a collaborative approach developed with the FABLE—Food, Agriculture, Biodiversity, Land, and Energy—Consortium to reconcile both global and national elements for developing national food and land-use system pathways. This approach includes three key features: (1) global targets, (2) country-driven multi-objective pathways, and (3) multiple iterations of pathway refinement informed by both national and international impacts. This approach strengthens policy coherence and highlights where greater national and international ambition is needed to achieve global goals (e.g., the SDGs). We discuss how this could be used to support future climate and biodiversity negotiations and what further developments would be needed. © 2022, The Author(s).","Climate change; Food system; Integrated models; Land use; Sustainability; Trade",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139516732

Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been previously recognized as a promising approach to systematically evaluating environmental impacts of NPs. As a result of their unique nanospecific properties, characterization factors (CF) were previously used for compensating the release and potential impacts of TiO2 NPs. However, because TiO2 NPs are known to generate reactive oxygen species and elicit toxicity to freshwater organisms, the lack of adequate UV-dependent effect factors (EFs) remains a major shortcoming when addressing their life cycle impacts. To complement the LCA of TiO2-NPs-enabled products under their specific applications, we recapitulated the freshwater toxicity of TiO2 NPs and then modeled in USEtox to determine trophic level EF ranges under UV and non-UV exposure conditions. Results indicate that EFs derived for non-UV exposure were 52 (42.9‒65) potentially affected fraction (PAF) m3/kg, and combined toxicity data derived EFs were 70.1 (55.6‒90.5) PAF m3/kg. When considering only the UV-induced exposure condition, the modeled EF increased to 500 (333‒712) PAF m3/kg. Our work highlights that case-dependent EFs should be considered and applied to reflect more realistic ecological impacts and illustrate comprehensive life cycle environmental impacts for nanoenabled products.

Environmental benefits and sustainable food production must be pursued locally and globally. Thus, a field experiment was conducted in 2015 to understand how to balance the trade-offs between agronomic productivity and environment quality in the North China Plain (NCP). Eight treatments consisted of two factors, i.e., (1) tillage practices: rotary tillage (RT) and no-till (NT), and (2) cropping sequences (CS): maize–wheat–soybean–wheat (MWSW), soybean–wheat–maize–wheat (SWMW), soybean–wheat (SW), and maize–wheat (MW). The economic and environmental benefits were evaluated by multiple indicators including the carbon footprint (CF), maize equivalent economic yield (MEEY), energy yield (EY), and carbon sustainability index (CSI). Compared with NT, RT increased the EY and MEEY, but emitted 9.4% higher GHGs. Among different CSs, no significant reduction was observed in CF. The lowest (2.0 Mg CO2-eq ha−1 year−1) and the highest (5.6 Mg CO2-eq ha−1 year−1) CF values were observed under MW and SWMW, respectively. However, CSs with soybean enhanced MEEY and the net revenue due to their higher price compared to that of MW. Although the highest CSI was observed under RT-MW, soybean-based crop rotation could offset the decline in CSI under NT when compared to that for RT. These findings suggest that conservation agriculture (CA) could enhance the balance in trade-offs between economic and environmental benefits. Additional research is needed on how to achieve high crop production by establishing a highly efficient CA system in the NCP. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon footprint; Carbon sustainability; Conservation agriculture; Crop rotation; Energy yield; Greenhouse gas emissions",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139509895

The purpose of this study is to identify and evaluate the sustainable enablers of AM. The research has identified 19 sustainable enablers of AM belonging to three areas: social, economic, and environmental, through an in-depth literature review. The decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) approach has been applied after taking inputs from industry experts to develop causal relationships (cause&#x2013;effect diagram) and to analyze each enabler&#x0027;s influence. The cause&#x2013;effect diagram has been developed based on threshold values. Our observations revealed that weight reduction, reduced time to market, mass customization, and personalization are the most critical enablers for sustainability. From visual representation, reduced toxicity of materials, no need for tooling, and ease of accessibility for remote part production have a substantial impact on effect enablers. This study will facilitate AM practitioners to systematically identify and prioritize essential enablers from a sustainability perspective. Practitioners should focus on these cause group enablers because it will help in controlling the effect of group enablers to improve sustainability in operations. Furthermore, insights from the study will enable policymakers to make policies leading to sustainable development. The novelty lies in identifying 19 enablers and incorporating the DEMATEL model to assess the causal relationship.

However, the environmental aspects of making such investments are yet to be addressed by the firms, which in turn, present considerable damage to the environment. Coupling with the natural resource-based view (NRBV) and the stakeholder theory of the firm, this research builds on an earlier work of Khalil and Nimmanunta (2021) in an attempt to examine the link between innovation and firms' environmental and financial value. The authors extend their analysis and document a more consistent approach to measuring environmental innovation which allows the authors to investigate the firms from three additional economies with respect to firms' investments in both traditional and environmental innovations. Design/methodology/approach: The underlying models are tested using the time fixed-effects panel regression by utilizing information from publicly traded companies of ten Asian economies, including Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Malaysia, Singapore, India, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia. The reported sample covers annual firm-level ESG data obtained from Thomson Reuters' Datastream and Refinitiv Eikon during the 2015–2019 period. Findings: This research offers support to the conventional wisdom that innovation is advantageous to the firms' market value. The authors further decompose innovation into traditional innovation and environmental innovation. The findings of this research suggest that traditional innovation is favorable only for the firms' market valuation and traditional innovation is strongly ineffectual for the environment – traditional innovation produces sizeable environmental distress by contributing substantially to carbon emissions. In contrast, the resultant effects of investments in environmental innovation are evident to be instrumental for both firms' financial performance and the environment. Research limitations/implications: This research has primarily focused on only two components of a company's environmental performance: reduction in carbon emissions (CO2) and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Given the complexity of firms' environmental strategies and the multidimensionality of the variable, which encompasses a wide range of corporate behavior in terms of relationships with communities, suppliers, consumers, and broader environmental responsibilities broadening the scope of the study by including other important aspects of environmental sustainability is, therefore, critical. Practical implications: The findings of this research signify environmental innovation as one of the vital investment approaches as firms can exploit benefits related to the market from firms' sustainable practices, developing eco-friendly processes by introducing steady yet systematic chains of green products and services. Such products and services may have a feature of enhanced functionality with a better layout in terms of improved product life with better recycling options, and lower consumption and exploitation of energy and natural resources. These sustainable practices would be advantageous for the firms regarding the possibility of setting prices above the standard level through establishing green brands and gaining market share of environmentally anxious consumers. For those companies that are striving to take the leading role in the green industry and longing to seek superior returns on the companies' environmental investments, these benefits, in particular, are exceptionally critical to them. Originality/value: The linkage between firms' financial and environmental performance in the context of simultaneous inclusion of both green and traditional innovations remains unclear and is yet to be investigated by researchers. Thus, this research shed light on the role of environmental innovation and traditional innovation on firms' environmental performance and financial performance. The authors utilize a novel dataset with a clear indication of measuring different elements of innovation that allows us to develop a more robust approach to corporates' environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance metrics having the slightest biases related to transparency and firm size. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Carbon emission; Environmental innovation; ESG; Firm performance; Impact investing; R&D; Sustainable investments",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139504128

By comparison, fewer studies address social sustainability in historical sites, particularly in the context of developing economies. Given the scarcity of such research, this study explores social-sustainability concerns in Hampi, India.

The United Nations has implemented the 2030 Agenda and has brought “quality education” and “industry, innovation, and infrastructure” as two of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The educational processes in higher education can be focused on adding brand value and social value, and they can be promoting the social inclusion. In this sense, the purpose of this study is to answer some questions related to the corporate sustainability practices under the 2030 Agenda lenses in the Latin American higher educational scenario. After the literature review analysis, a conceptual framework was developed. Design/methodology/approach: This exploratory research study proposes an educational conceptual framework, improving the corporate sustainability under the 2030 Agenda lenses. A literature review was developed, involving the seven variables: “Latin America,” “higher education,” corporate social responsibility,” “personal social responsibility,” “corporate sustainability,” “governance” and “sustainability.” A matrix was developed with 25 variable combinations, connecting the seven variables. Three questions have been proposed and answered: “How much research has been developed in the Latin American higher education?” “How can the corporate social sustainability be applied in higher education?” and “Which perspectives can be considered?” Findings: The results of the literature review are presented through the number of papers found with the analysis of the year of publication and the conceptual background. A total of 524 papers were found. Of these studies, 49 addressed the Latin American panorama, 33 had a general approach and 16 promoted interactions between Latin American and European countries, as well as between regions and continents. Six topics emerged from the literature analysis: digital inclusion, internationalization, innovation, research, servitization and social inclusion. These topics are connected in the “discussion” section, and the educational conceptual framework shows the corporative perspectives on sustainability in higher education. Originality/value: This research study presents “A conceptual framework for the corporate sustainability higher education in Latin America” and it brings some discussion topics: digital inclusion, internationalization, innovation, research, servitization and social inclusion. These topics were identified through the literature analysis, and they were applied in the conceptual framework to improve the quality of education. The implications of this study are connected with the conceptual framework to promote the discussion topics. The implications involved the public and private governance spheres, third sector, as well as the professors, students and other stakeholders of higher educational institutions. These implications can represent an agent of positive change in the Latin American scenario. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2030 Agenda; Conceptual framework; Corporate sustainability; Higher education; Latin America",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139498997

Unconsolidated Undrained (UU) tests were performed to identify the effect of lime dosage, compaction water content and curing time on the shear strength and stress-strain behaviour of the treated soil. The mineralogical and physicochemical transformations occurring during the curing stage of the soil were also monitored to support the interpretation of the triaxial testing results and verify hypotheses made on the evolution of the chemical reactions and the development of cementation bonds. The results showed that strengths gain was strongly influenced by lime content and the curing period, whereas the compaction water content was less influential. An interesting finding of practical relevance is that the strength evolution is likely to continue over long periods of time and result in very considerable strength gains upon the hardening of pozzolanic reaction products. At the same time, adequate early strength gains and adequate soil treatment can be obtained with reduced use of material consumption, thus further increasing the sustainability of the treatment processes. The paper has also highlighted the importance for engineering design of considering the brittle stress-strain response of the lime treated soil, and the benefit of using lower amounts of lime to alleviate this undesirable effect. The implications of various aspects of soil brittleness in different situations merit further attention and should be explored via modelling in future work. © 2022 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.",,"Clay; Compaction; Curing; Fracture mechanics; Hydrated lime; Shear flow; Shear strength; Soil testing; Clay soil; Curing time; England; London clay; Shears strength; Strength behavior; Strength gain; Strength property; Stress strain behaviours; Undrained tests; Lime",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139498654

However, recent scientific literature is still lacking in the case of insect meal effects on different stages of salmonid fish, and the vast majority of research is focused on farmed Atlantic salmon. Therefore, the holistic approach was undertaken in the cycle of two studies carried out: on fries and pre-smolts. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of fish meal (FM) replacement by full-fat BSFM in Atlantic salmon fry diets on the growth performance, feed utilization, crude protein and crude fat digestibility, somatic indices, histomorphology of intestines, and environmental sustainability. Additionally, pellet quality was assessed. Two experiments were performed on 360 Atlantic salmon fries-each of which lasted 60 days. For the first experiment, 240 individuals were distributed to four experimental groups: six replicates (tanks) per group and 10 fish per tank. For the second experiment, 120 individuals were distributed to four experimental groups: Three replicates (tanks) per group and 10 fish per tank were used. The following groups were applied: CON-without the addition of full-fat BSFM and with 39% FM; BSFM5-with 5% addition of full-fat BSFM and 36.1% FM; BSFM10-with 10% full-fat BSFM and 33.3% FM; BSFM15-with 15% addition of full-fat BSFM and 30.3% FM. The present study showed satisfactory results of BSFM inclusion at the levels of 5% and 10% as a replacement for fish meal in feeds for Atlantic salmon fries. No negative effects on growth performance, feed utilization, protein and fat digestibility, or intestinal structure were recorded. Simultaneously, insect meal inclusion in Atlantic salmon diets significantly improved the environmental sustainability of the feed. In the case of BSFM15, decreases in body weight gain, protein lipid efficiency ratio, and lipid efficiency ratio, as well as increases in feed conversion ratio, were observed. Therefore, the use of shares higher than 10% of BSFM in Atlantic salmon fries may not be recommended. © 2022 Zuzanna Mikołajczak et al., published by Sciendo 2022.","Atlantic salmon nutrition; black soldier fly; innovative feed materials; insect meals; sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139497598

To meet any voltage requirement for practical applications, two types of interconnection methods, such as banded and flip-flop interconnections, have been widely used to integrate TECs in electrical series. However, these methods involve injecting an electrolyte into each cell one at a time and reliably sealing the cells, which becomes challenging when connecting a large numbers of TECs. To address this issue, we propose a separation-free planar series interconnection (SPSI) configuration that allows TECs to be electrically connected in series using a single electrolyte injection and sealing process, resulting in a simple TEC integration method. An electrochemical equivalent circuit for the SPSI configuration is investigated to determine design parameters affecting the output voltage and power from the TECs. As a practical demonstration, a strip-shaped TEC device consisting of 25 cells is fabricated and wrapped around a heat pipe to convert the temperature difference between the surface of a heat pipe and its surroundings into electricity. The introduction of this interconnection method would induce significant advances in TEC integration and application. © 2022 American Chemical Society.","energy harvesting; equivalent circuit; flexible electronics; thermoelectrochemical cells; voltage; waste heat","Cells; Cytology; Electrolytes; Equivalent circuits; Flexible electronics; Heat pipes; Internet of things; Timing circuits; Waste heat; Cell integration; Injection process; Integration method; Interconnection method; Low grade; Sealing process; Simple++; Thermo-electrochemical cells; Voltage requirement; Wearable devices; Energy harvesting",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139481342

To effectively monitor and manage resources use and waste disposal toward sustainability, this study intended to explore different metabolic paths of the urban built environment, as well as strategies for new and old urban areas separately with the help of material stock and flow analysis. Based on snapshots of 2003, 2010, and 2017 and combined with big data, a four-dimensional geographic information system buildings database of Lixia District in Jinan, China, was compiled for bottom-up stock modeling. Finally, the environmental impact assessment of the buildings’ demolition and disposal stage was carried out. The results showed that the building material stock was 142.31 Mt in 2017, with an increase of 69% from 2003. The reinforced concrete buildings increased rapidly from 2003 to 2017, especially in new urban areas, which has boosted demand for steel and cement by more than 150% during these 15 years. The material stock of the old urban area tends to be saturated, whereas the new urban area has experienced a rapid expansion with the material inflow four times as large as the material outflow. Potential recycling of waste concrete can reduce the generation of building demolition waste by 50%, save 0.15 km2 of land occupation, increase raw material substitution by nearly 10 times, and reduce CO2 emissions by 2.5 times. © 2022 by the International Society for Industrial Ecology.","buildings; environmental impact; geographic information systems; industrial ecology; material stock and flows analysis; urban metabolism and sustainability","Demolition; Energy utilization; Environmental impact assessments; Geographic information systems; Information systems; Metabolism; Reinforced concrete; Sustainable development; Waste disposal; Building demolition; Built environment; Flow analysis; Industrial ecology; Material stock and flow analyse; Stock analysis; Stocks and flows; Urban areas; Urban metabolisms; Urban sustainability; Information use",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139479142

The primary activity of UTL in the initial years was leather jackets and purses. It sold its products under the brand name Brown Cliff. It shifted its manufacturing units from Kanpur to the nearby town of Unnao to cut costs and increase capacity in 1990. It later expanded its product range to primarily include leather footwear, targeting the menswear market. It became one of the top players in the northern part of the country with a proper business strategy. The footwear segment was growing rapidly and profitably for UTL. The business was smooth for almost four decades with minor hiccups until the government imposed a ban on its functioning due to a sparse wastewater disposal system in May 2019. The initial ban was prolonged further due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the country in March 2020. As a result, UTL suffered a significant loss in sales and clients. Reviving demand for the products after the easing of partial lockdown in the country was a daunting task. UTL became a contractual manufacturer for CONTE to utilize its idle resources and reduce its financial burden. Later, UTL got an offer from Batla Leather Products Limited (BLPL) to become its contract manufacturer. BLPL was one of the top players in the national and international market and it was looked for facilities to quickly scale up its operations. This case allows the readers to put themselves in Mr Sadiq Monir’s shoes and analyse an unforeseen business situation. The choice between short-term profits and sustainability versus long-term growth of the family brand Brown Cliff had to be made. The case gives several macro and micro factors supporting the choices and the decision to be made. The decision dilemma has two facets—to gain expertise in improving operations and to have a steady flow of income for the next 2–3 years versus risking the loss of independence and dilution of the family brand Brown Cliff. © 2022 Lahore University of Management Sciences.","Business strategy; crisis management; marketing; pricing strategy; product management",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139477775

A set of recombinant strains derived from the industrial strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae CAT-1 was developed for this purpose. First, two recombinant strains were obtained by the chromosomal insertion of genes involved in the assimilation and transport of D-xylose (Gal2-N376F). Strain CAT-1-XRT was developed with heterologous genes for D-xylose metabolism from the oxo-reductive pathway of Scheffersomyces stipitis (XYL1-K270R, XYL2); and strain CAT-1-XIT, with D-xylose isomerase (xylA gene, XI) from Streptomyces coelicolor. Moreover, both recombinant strains contained extra copies of homologous genes for xylulose kinase (XK) and transaldolase (TAL1). Furthermore, plasmid (pRS42K::XI) was constructed with xylA from Piromyces sp. transferred to CAT-1, CAT-1-XRT, and CAT-1-XIT, followed by an evolution protocol. After 10 subcultures, CAT-1-XIT (pRS42K::XI) consumed 74% of D-xylose, producing 12.6 g/L ethanol (0.31 g ethanol/g D-xylose). The results of this study show that CAT-1-XIT (pRS42K::XI) is a promising recombinant strain for the efficient utilization of D-xylose to produce ethanol from lignocellulosic materials. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bioethanol; D-xylose isomerase; Lignocellulosic biomass; Saccharomyces cerevisiae","Bioethanol; Biomass; Fermentation; Genes; Sustainable development; Xylose; Yeast; Bio-ethanols; D-Xylose; D-xylose isomerase; Environmental sustainability; Ethanol production; Industrial strain; Lignocellulosic biomass; Recombinant strains; Xylose fermentation; Xylose isomerase; Ethanol",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139476282

The closure of world heritage properties and performance venues due to the global pandemic has resulted in a global employment crisis and the subsequent departure of many seasoned Cantonese opera artists, inarguably threatening the sustainability of cultural heritage development and disrupting the transmission process. This paper investigates the intertwined relationship between transmission, traumatic crisis, and cultural heritage professionals (CHPs) through the lens of 56 Cantonese opera artists in Hong Kong. Utilising the transactional theory of stress and coping, this paper critically examines the role, psychological responses, and subsequent actions of Cantonese opera artists amid traumatic crisis. The findings contribute to the scholarship on cultural transmission by documenting the impact of social mobilisation, paradigm shifts on tradition, career crisis, vocational behavioural changes, and digital transformation on safeguarding intangible cultural heritage amid trauma. This paper argues that positive coping is related to post-traumatic growth and industrial transformation, highlighting the urgency for Hong Kong and the world to develop preparedness for a road map of cultural heritage transmission to coexist with the pandemic or other traumatic crises in this age of global challenges. ©, Fanny Ming-Yan Chung.","Cantonese opera; Chinese opera; Cultural transmission; digital transformation; intangible cultural heritage; pandemic",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139476255

However, even a small amount can cause serious ecological problems. Global warming, on which cement production has a significant impact, has led to greater awareness of cement replacement materials. In this study, composites of alluvium clay with various percentages of cement (7%, 10%, and 13%) and two different proportions of coal bottom ash (20% and 40%) in two different densities (1,600 and 1,800 kg/m3) at 7, 28, and 60 days of curing period were prepared to investigate engineering properties, microstructure, and sustainability performance. Porosity, strength, and initial shear modulus values of composites were determined and strength-porosity relationships were proposed for these materials at all curing ages. The microstructure of the composites was investigated to evaluate the mechanism of the chemical reactions. The 20% coal bottom ash replacement level showed the highest strength (≈30% compared with control samples) and the highest improvement in the initial shear modulus. Samples with 13% cement and 40% coal bottom ash showed an 8% reduction in porosity at 60 days. The proposed relationships could be valuable to estimate the engineering properties of coal bottom ash clay blends and promotes higher waste utilization in civil engineering applications based on the coal bottom ash content and density. Additionally, the sustainability performance of laboratory-produced composites was analyzed based on equivalent carbon dioxide (eCO2) emission, embodied energy, and cost calculation.

Self-defined criteria, transparency, trust, and accessibility have made PGS an attractive alternative to exogenous certification in local markets in over 70 countries. There is also increasing interest in the possibilities for participatory certification in international trade for family farm-based products such as cocoa or coffee. Bolivia’s PGS was established in 2012. By 2017, the country ranked second (after India) in number of PGS farmers. Since 2019, however, its numbers are declining. Visiting six PGS initiatives, we interviewed 38 persons from production, processing, distribution, support networks, and policymaking on the current situation of PGS in Bolivia; its challenges; its prospects in local, national, and international trade; and the role of Bolivia’s governmental PGS support. While PGS certification in Bolivia faces challenges–including high fees, weak consumer demand, and insufficient links to broader value chains–it displays strong potential to make locally managed sustainability certification more accessible. We recommend that decision-makers ensure accessibility and help promote PGS with consumers. Importing countries could support PGS, in particular by incentivizing access of PGS-certified products to their national markets by recognizing them as organic via peer-to-peer certification. © 2022 The Author(s).

The assessment of urban ecological security (UES) provides an effective spatial approach for sustainable urban ecological planning and management. But, in the Indian context, the assessment of UES remains still unexplored. This study aims to construct a UES index (UESI) in Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA), India, that can be helpful for ecological sustainability. For the development of UESI, a total of 14 indices were taken into account under four major sun-indexes (human activity index or HAI, urban surface ecological status or USES, ecological health index or EHI and urbanness index or UI). Spearman correlation analysis and ordinary least square (OLS) were performed to show the relationship between variables and the impact of the variables on ecological security patterns. From the result of the study, it was found that (i) about 25% and 13% of the total urban centres came under the category of the insecure and relatively insecure category (ii) Most of the areas with insecure and relatively insecure category were located around Kolkata and its surrounding areas (such as Howrah, Bidhan Nagar, Dum Dum, Rajarhat, Baranagar, North Dum Dum) (iii) there was a negative correlation of ecological security index (ESI) with HAI and (r = −0.65) UI (r = −0.91); and positive correlation with USES (r = 0.797) and EHI (r = 0.879). As per OLS, six selected variables (settlement change, population density, population growth, land surface temperature, ecosystem service value, and normalized difference built-up index) explained more than 80% variation in ecological security pattern. Thus, a creased approach has been constructed to evaluate ecological security patterns by integrating multiple index systems. The comprehensive findings of the study provide a significant quantification framework for identifying ecological security patterns, and spatial mapping will be a fundamental support to urban spatial planning. © 2022 World Bank.","Ecological sustainability; Ecosystem services; Indicator based assessment; Kolkata Metropolitan Area; urban ecological security",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139472971

Because of the still present problem of overfished seas and oceans for feed purposes, even a low substitution of the mentioned feed materials could have a positive impact on the environment. Due to the specificity of salmon metabolic processes, with particular attention to smoltification and the various requirements for nutrients related to individual stages, it is important to implement similar dietary inclusion levels of innovative feed materials in different life stages of Atlantic salmon. Thus, a holistic approach was undertaken in the cycle of two studies carried out: on fries and pre-smolts. This study aims to evaluate the effect of FM replacement by full-fat BSFM in Atlantic salmon pre-smolt diets on growth performance, feed utilization, somatic indices, histomorphology of intestines, colorimetric assessment and raw meat quality, as well as environmental sustainability. The following groups were applied: CON-without addition of full-fat BSFM and with 30% FM; BSFM5-with 5% addition of full-fat BSFM and 27.1% FM; BSFM10-with 10% full-fat BSFM and 24.3% FM; and BSFM15-with 15% addition of full-fat BSFM and 21.3% FM. The present study showed satisfactory results of BSFM inclusion up to 15% as a replacement for FM in feeds for Atlantic salmon pre-smolts. The present study showed that BSFM is a suitable feed material for Atlantic salmon proper diet balancing and may be used to decrease FM content. The semi-Technical application of BSFM containing diets confirmed their effectiveness during the growth phase of Atlantic salmon. According to our results, BSFM can be recommended as an alternative feed component in Atlantic salmon pre-smolt nutrition at levels up to 15%. Simultaneously, insect inclusion significantly improved the environmental sustainability of the rearing process. © 2022 Zuzanna Mikołajczak et al., published by Sciendo 2022.","Atlantic salmon nutrition; black soldier fly; innovative feed materials; insect meals; sustainability","article; environmental sustainability; fish meal; growth curve; histopathology; human; intestine; lipid diet; nonhuman; raw meat; rearing; Salmo salar; smolt; soldier (insect)",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139471972

Among the many fruit fibers, Areca fruit husk fiber (AFHF) stands out and has been discovered in considerable quantities being rejected by tobacco processing enterprises. The investigation of AFHFs, helps to utilize the wealth out of iste in an eco-friendly nature for reinforcement in polymer composites. In light of this, the current work deals with AFHFs collected from agricultural enterprises and processed as raw fibers, which were further combined with unsaturated polyester resin to create a natural polymer composite material. Additionally, using Taguchi’s design technique, an orthogonal array is constructed by including process parameters and their stages when conducting testing. The influence of various fiber widths on various gauge distances has been discussed, as well as the optimal width and span for defining the possible tensile strength using Taguchi’s single response analysis.

Intercropping may improve water use efficiency and increase agricultural production sustainability. The aim of this research was to evaluate the growth and yield of forage cactus genotypes intercropped with timber species under semi-arid conditions. Three forage cactus genotypes, erect prickly pear ‘Orelha de Elefante Mexicana’ [O. stricta (Haw.) Haw.], ‘Miúda’ [N. cochenillifera (L.) Salm-Dyck: syn. O. cochenillifera (L.) Mill.], and ‘Baiana’ [N. cochenillifera (L.) Salm-Dyck] in three cropping systems (monocropping; intercropped with Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC.; and intercropped with Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth.) were studied. All species were irrigated with treated domestic effluent water. Plants were evaluated after 2 yr of cultivation. The forage cactus intercropped with timber species had lower cladode weight, dry matter yield, and lower carrying capacity than forage cactus in monocropped system regardless of genotype. These results suggest that timber species may inhibit the yield of forage cactus, and intercropping is not recommended. In addition, there was no significant difference in the performance of forage cactus when intercropping with M. caesalpiniifolia and P. juliflora. The P. juliflora had greater growth performance when compared with M. caesalpiniifolia intercropped with Miúda and Orelha de Elefante Mexicana. However, when intercropped with the Baiana, the growth of P. juliflora and M. caesalpiniifolia are similar to each other. © 2022 The Authors.

A study of the interrelationships between the principles of sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR) would be advantageous, given the prevalence of unequal opportunities and access to resources in a global economy (CSR). To address global and diverse challenges, fieldwork and their relationships must be examined. In this context, the current study aims to investigate the linkages between the concepts of CSR and sustainability to better understand current scientific advances and future research prospects. Design/methodology/approach: The bibliometric analysis technique is applied in the implementation of this study project. To find the existing links, a total of 3,079 publications on the themes of sustainability and CSR were analysed. The research works from Scopus were chosen because they have a large number of papers, authors and journals while meeting the peer-review standard for scientifictuality, and they have a high number of papers, authors and journals. Findings: As a result, interest in this field of study has grown significantly, with Garca-Sánchez being the most productive author, Business, Management and Accounting is the most researched topic, and sustainability Switzerland being the most productive publication. The USA has the most articles and citations, whereas Salamanca University is the most prolific producer. Future research should concentrate on the social dimension and its implications for the Circular Economy. Finally, a research line is presented that integrates recommendations from the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

Despite such well-intentioned motivations, these public forms of urban nature have always been to some extent bounded, serving some in favor of others, authorizing particular uses and forms of behavior as more or less legitimate, and policing the boundaries of who is/not included in such space. In this paper, we argue that new interventions seeking to bring nature-based solutions (NBS) into the city serve to further trouble these boundaries. NBS seek to use nature to address urban sustainability challenges and they navigate and serve to reconfigure what is (and is not) public in the city. We draw on research undertaken in three cities–Newcastle (United Kingdom), Cape Town (South Africa) and Athens (Greece) to explore the ways in which notions of the private and the public are being remade with and through nature, and its implications for how we might understand urban politics. Our conclusions point to the need for governance arrangements that can support the long-term stewardship of nature in the public interest and with due accountability and we suggest three arrangements. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, the existing literature is limited on the role of team voice in predicting employee voice behavior. The authors proposed that team members' voices serve as a cue for engagement in felt obligation for constructive change, which sets the path for employees' engagement in promotive and prohibitive voice behavior. This study further proposed that supervisor expectation for voice may alter the relationship between team voice and felt obligation for constructive change of employees. The authors' proposed model is based on social information processing theory. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected from 313 telecommunication sector employees and the companies supervisors through a multi-source time-lagged design. Linear regression analysis and the Preacher and Hayes Process for mediation and moderation were used to test the proposed hypothesis. Findings: The results support the direct effect of team voice on promotive and prohibitive voice behavior, and the indirect effect of team voice on promotive voice behavior through the mediation of felt obligation for constructive change was also supported. However, mediation of felt obligation for constructive change between team voice and prohibitive voice behavior was not supported. The results also support the moderation of supervisor expectation for voice between team voice and felt obligation for constructive change. Originality/value: Findings of the study may help organizational practitioners and managers about the value of promotive and prohibitive voice behavior for better team functioning through team voice. The study also highlights the importance of supervisor expectations for voice to strengthen the association between team voice and felt obligation for constructive change among employees. Both dimensions of voice behavior, i.e. promotive and prohibitive voice, are crucial for improved organizational functioning and preventing the organization from harm and loss. Organizations should create environments high on voice behavior to remain competitive and meet the challenges of dynamic business environments. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Felt obligation for constructive change; Promotive and prohibitive voice; Supervisor expectations for voice; Team voice",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139455771

Air pollution has become a critical environmental issue in recent decades. Forecasts of air quality play an important role in warning people about and controlling air pollution. Considerable research has been devoted to predicting instances of poor air quality, but most studies are limited by insufficient longitudinal data, making it difficult to account for seasonal and other factors. Several prediction models have been developed using an 8-year dataset collected by Beijing Environmental Protection Monitoring Center (BEPMC). The small spatial and temporal scales and nonlinearity of climate effects are significant challenges to precise Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction. As a result, data normalization is applied to enhance air quality features without distorting divergences. Machine learning methods, including simple linear regression (SLR), support vector regressor (SVR), random forest (RF), and probabilistic voting ensemble, were used to build regression models for predicting the AQI of six central and outskirt regions of Beijing city. The mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to evaluate the performance of the regression models. Experimental results showed that the max probabilistic voting ensemble performed better in the prediction of the AQI in terms of R2, whereas RF performed better in the prediction of the AQI in terms of MAE and RMSE scores. The overall performance of the proposed model in terms of MAE and RMSE is between 0.0128 to 0.0194 and 0.0230 to 0.0326, respectively. This work also illustrates that combining ensemble learning consisting of various classifiers’ output weights with air quality prediction is an efficient and convenient way to solve certain significant environmental problems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Air pollution; Air quality prediction; Environmental impacts; Environmental sustainability; Machine learning techniques",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139453499

Although often discussed separately, these five challenges may share a common cause: insufficient investment of intellectual and nonintellectual resources into the typical psychology study. We suggest that the emerging emphasis on big-team science can help address these challenges by allowing researchers to pool their resources together to increase the amount available for a single study. However, the current incentives, infrastructure, and institutions in academic science have all developed under the assumption that science is conducted by solo principal investigators and their dependent trainees, an assumption that creates barriers to sustainable big-team science. We also anticipate that big-team science carries unique risks, such as the potential for big-team-science organizations to be co-opted by unaccountable leaders, become overly conservative, and make mistakes at a grand scale. Big-team-science organizations must also acquire personnel who are properly compensated and have clear roles. Not doing so raises risks related to mismanagement and a lack of financial sustainability. If researchers can manage its unique barriers and risks, big-team science has the potential to spur great progress in psychology and beyond. © The Author(s) 2022.","allied field: philosophy; allied field: sociology; big-team science; metascience; methodology: scientific",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139453047

We propose an Ordinal Priority Approach (OPA) method for determining the criteria weights and application of fuzzy Dombi Bonferroni (DOBI) methodology for the evaluation of alternatives. When compared to the other three alternatives in this study, the results show that deploying autonomous buses in mixed traffic is the most advantageous option.

Aim: To use Lifedoc Health (LDH) as a LMP exemplar by describing their multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach to diabetes care along with tactics to address sustainability challenges. Results: The LDH model facilitates early activation of patients with diabetes and other cardiometabolic risk factors, MDT approaches, and protocols/policies that are able to overcome barriers to equitable healthcare in the community. Specific programmatic targets are clinical outcomes, effective dissemination, economic viability, and sustainability. Infrastructure centers on patient-driven problem-based visits, shared medical appointments, telemedicine, and patient tracking. Further discussions on program conceptualization and operationalization are provided. Conclusion: Even though strategic plans for LMPs that specialize in diabetes care are well represented in the literature, implementation protocols, and performance metrics are lacking. The LDH experience provides a starting point for those healthcare professionals interested in translating ideas into action. © Copyright 2022 The Author(s).","dysglycemia-based chronic disease; lifedoc health; lifestyle medicine center; lifestyle medicine program; multidisciplinary team",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139446196

In kidney care, nephrology NP can manage patients at various points along the chronic kidney disease (CKD) trajectory. Objectives: To profile the characteristics, service patterns, and domains of practice of nephrology NP in Australia. Design: A cross-sectional online secure survey. Participants: Nephrology NP (NP students) who were members of the Renal Society of Australasia and working in Australia (n = 73). Measurements: Data collected were demographic and practice characteristics, and domains of practice (using the modified Strong Model of Advanced Practice). The survey also sought qualitative perspectives of the enablers and barriers to sustainability nurse practitioner healthcare delivery services. Results: Nephrology NP (n = 45) primarily worked in adult services, managing those receiving haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or patients with earlier grades of CKD. Providing direct comprehensive care was the dominant domain of advanced practice although administrative activities took up considerable time each week. Support from nurse leaders and medical colleagues was identified as key enablers for sustainability of these services whereas succession planning, and workload were the main barriers. Conclusions: This study found a highly qualified, experienced but older nephrology nurse practitioner workforce who provide an additional model of health service delivery which can meet the growing CKD burden. Internationally, this level of nurse provides an opportunity for a career pathway to maintain nurses in direct clinical roles and to expand the nephrology nursing workforce. © 2022 The Authors.

But planetary resources are currently being degraded and this poses an existential threat to human health and the sustainability of our healthcare systems. The aims of this study were to (1) describe an approach to integrate environmental impacts in a cost analysis; and (2) demonstrate this approach by estimating select environmental impacts alongside traditional health system and other costs using the example of the pilot MEL-SELF randomised controlled trial of patient-led melanoma surveillance. Methods: Economic costs were calculated alongside a randomised trial using standard cost analysis methodology from a societal perspective. Environmental impacts were calculated using a type of carbon footprinting methodology called process-based life cycle analysis. This method considers three scopes of carbon emissions: Scope 1, which occur directly from the intervention; Scope 2, which occur indirectly from the intervention’s energy use; and Scope 3, which occur indirectly because of the value chain of the intervention. In this study we only included emissions from patient transport to attend their melanoma clinic over the study period of 6 months. Results: The environmental impact per participant across allocated groups for patient transport to their melanoma clinic was estimated to be 10 kg carbon dioxide equivalent. Economic costs across the allocated groups indicated substantial health system costs, out-of-pocket costs, and productivity losses associated with melanoma surveillance. The largest cost contributor was health system costs, and the most expensive category of health system cost was hospital admission. Conclusion: Calculating environmental impacts is worthwhile and feasible within a cost analysis framework. Further work is needed to address outstanding conceptual and practical issues so that a comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts can be considered alongside economic costs in health technology assessments. © 2022, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139443967

Regarding such a situation, this article describes the effects of rock fragmentation by blasting on the energy consumption, productivity, minerals’ recovery, operational costs in the whole size reduction chain from mining to mineral processing, and the sustainability of mining industry. The main factors that influence rock fragmentation are analysed such as explosive, initiator, rock, and energy distribution including blast design, and the models for predicting rock fragmentation are briefly introduced. In addition, two important issues—fines and ore blending—are shortly presented. Furthermore, the feasibility of achieving an optimum fragmentation (satisfied by a minimum cost from drilling-blasting to crushing-grinding, maximum ore recovery ratio, high productivity, and minimum negative impact on safety and environment) is analysed. The analysis indicates that this feasibility is high. Finally, the measures and challenges for achieving optimum fragmentation are discussed.

Raising a concern in the direction of recycling and minerals extraction. With the inclination over utilizing green energy ways of power production. The solar sector has been ambushed and still in progress to satisfy the daily surpassing limits of power demand. Being a better choice to reduce carbon emission the solar setups are in a process of capturing acres of lands and water bodies. As a result, all along with it, the life span or service period of solar panel also needs to be on count. Off servicing a solar panel assembly leaves its set up open and exposed to the environment. Its construction utilizes minerals like cadmium, gallium, germanium, tellurium etc. all in creation of modules but after its lifespan, majority of panel assemblies found at garbage's etc. and serves as pollutant. This linear economy chain needs to be channelized. High need of recycling framework at government, industry and residential level is required to provide better end of life disposal.

However, few studies have evaluated field conditions where livestock wastes have been used for extended periods of time. In this study, physicochemical parameters, metabarcoding of the 16S rRNA gene, and ecotoxicity indexes were used for the characterization of chicken manure and poultry litter to examine the effect of their application to agricultural soils for 10 years. Poultry wastes showed high concentrations of nutrients and increased electrical conductivity leading to phytotoxic effects on seeds. The bacterial communities were dominated by typical members of the gastrointestinal tract, noting the presence of pathogenic bacteria. Soils subjected to poultry manure applications showed statistically higher values of total and extractable phosphorous, increasing the risk of eutrophication. Moreover, while the soil bacterial community remained dominated by the ones related to the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients and plant growth promotion, losses of alpha diversity were observed on treated soils. Altogether, our work would contribute to understand the effects of common local agricultural practices and support the adoption of the waste treatment process in compliance with environmental sustainability guidelines. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Chicken litter; Metabarcoding; Organic amendment; Poultry manure; Soil bacterial diversity",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139435810

However, multi-objective synergistic strategies are unclear on a farmer scale. In this study, we quantified indicators of soil fertility (soil organic matter (SOM)), environmental impact (global warming potentials (GWP)), and economic benefit (ratio of benefit and cost (BCR)) and analysed the synergetic strategies based on survey data from 230 smallholders in the Yangtze River Basin (Shanghai City, Chongqing City, Zhejiang province, and Jiangxi province). The average SOM, GWP, and BCR were 28.9 g kg−1, 17.3 t CO2-eq ha−1, and 3.63, respectively. Furthermore, optimised solutions using the Pareto multiple-objective optimisation model can reduce the GWP by 44.6% and improve the SOM and BCR by 34.4% and 43.9%, respectively, when fertiliser N rate and density are both decreased and the ratio of organic fertiliser application is increased compared to farmer management practices. The structural equation model indicated that planting density and fertiliser N rate can directly influence GWP and indirectly increase SOM and BCR; organic fertiliser application directly affects the GWP, SOM, and BCR. Our research provides a bottom-up approach based on the farmer scale, which can improve the sustainability of pear systems, and these findings can be used as guidelines for policymakers and pear orchard managers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Density; Economic benefit; Environmental impacts; Global warming potential (GWP); Life cycle analysis (LCA); Multi-objective optimisation; N fertiliser; Soil fertility",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139434782

This has been attracting increasing interest in composites reinforced with natural fibers, mainly to replace synthetic materials. In this context, the present research work aimed to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the production of polyester-polymeric-matrix composites reinforced with fibers of Luffa cylindrica and a hybrid with fiberglass. The composites' physical properties (density, moisture content, water absorption, and thickness swelling) and mechanical properties (tensile, bending strength, and Rockwell hardness (RH)) were assessed. The composites were produced through cold pressing in a closed mold. The experiment was performed according to an entirely randomized design with two replicates per treatment and the means were compared by the Tukey test at 95% probability. The results demonstrated that the reinforcement with the Luffa fibers promoted a decrease in the density of the composites, with a minimum value of 1.01 g cm−3. In the assays of tensile strength, the reinforced composite presented a value of 10.20 MPa for this property, while for the bending strength, the value was 18.04 MPa. When the Luffa fibers were employed in the hybrid composite, the bending strength reached 105.12 MPa. In general, the composites reinforced with the plant fibers and the hybrid had physical and mechanical properties permitting their employment for several end-uses, according to the characteristics of each one. The new composites are partially biodegradable, sustainable, and light. © The Author(s) 2022.","Lignocellulosic fibers; scanning electron microscopy; sustainability in the production of composites; synthetic fibers","Bending strength; Density (specific gravity); Environmental technology; Global warming; Hybrid composites; Natural fibers; Polymer matrix composites; Reinforced plastics; Scanning electron microscopy; Swelling; Tensile strength; Water absorption; Environmental preservation; Lignocellulosic fibres; Luffa cylindrica; Luffa fibers; Overexploitation; Polyester composites; Polymeric matrix composites; Sustainability in the production of composite; Synthetic materials; Thickness swelling; Sustainable development",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139433429

The availability of this new class of nanomaterials has helped heterogeneous catalysis and surface research in particular, as the atomic structure shown on the surface of a nanocrystal is ultimately governed by its geometric form. The immediate benefits might include a considerable increase in catalytic activity or selectivity, as well as a significant decrease in material costs, all while offering a well-defined model system for mechanistic investigation. This review paper presents a complete overview of recent developments in the synthesis of noble-metal nanocrystals with well-tuned morphologies, as well as their outstanding performance in a wide range of catalytic activities in organic synthesis. Nanocrystals having different shapes such as cubic, cuboctahedra, octahedra, rhombic dodecahedra, etc. exhibited a major role in facet-dependent catalytic activity in the organic synthesis. Synthesis of organic molecules such as heterocyclic molecule synthesis, coupling reaction (C−C coupling), hydrogenation reaction, oxidation, and peptide synthesis are highly affected by nanocrystals with a particular surface facet. We expect that this review article will provide the motivation and a pathway for the development of next-generation catalysts, which are critical in a variety of applications for organic synthesis. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","facet-dependent property; Metal nanocrystals; organic synthesis; selectivity; sustainability","Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Hydrogenation; Molecules; Precious metals; Synthesis (chemical); Effective synthesis; Facet-dependent property; Geometric form; Material cost; Metal nanocrystals; Nanocrystal facets; Organic synthesis; Physicochemical characteristics; Property; Selectivity; Nanocrystals",Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139431710

Electropolymerization by the initial electrode reaction eliminates energy consumption in the beforehand polymerization process and provides a simple method to synthesize polymeric cathode materials. The possible bond connection mode of 2,6-NAPD monomers was proposed using the 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier-transform infrared spectra. Scanning electron microscopy shows that the irregular 2,6-NAPD monomers form multilayered sheets after long-term cycling.

This movement is also spreading far beyond the small group of people who recognize as “green”. This is the first study to demonstrate that domestic sewage water can be utilized as anodic feed for the electrochemical production of H2O2 in the catholyte with simultaneous wastewater treatment in a microbial peroxide-producing cell (MPPC) designed cost-effectively utilizing a variety of catholyte and few electrode materials. The electrochemical output utilizing domestic wastewater resulted in maximum production of 62 mM H2O2 in a 37-day batch in the MPPC with 50 mM H2SO4 catholyte having a bare activated charcoal electrode. The constantly rising H2O2 production during the 37-day hydraulic retention time demonstrated the system's sustainability and efficiency in contrast to other reported studies. Cyclic voltammetry analysis of the catholyte with the Fenton process showed excellent redox peaks, indicating its applicability for in-situ pollutant degradation. The MPPCs had an overall 40%–60% and 65%–85% removal efficiency of biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. This study shows that a simple MPPC design with no extensive modifications can be efficient at producing H2O2 and simultaneously treating wastewater. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","domestic sewage water; hydrogen peroxide production; microbial fuel cell; MPPC; sustainable and cost-effective treatment; wastewater treatment","Biochemical oxygen demand; Competition; Cost effectiveness; Cyclic voltammetry; Efficiency; Electrochemical electrodes; Hydrogen peroxide; Microbial fuel cells; Oxidation; Oxygen; Sewage; Sustainable development; Cost effective treatments; Domestic sewage; Domestic sewage water; Electrochemicals; Global competitiveness; Hydrogen peroxide production; Microbial peroxide-producing cell; Sewage water; Sewage-treatment plants; Sustainable and cost-effective treatment; Wastewater treatment",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139424647

It is used to process the waste byproduct named Black Liquor to enhance its solid concentration that may be further utilized to produce biomass-based energy. This process accounts very high energy consumption which leads to the energy intensiveness of this unit. A substantial amount of energy-saving may be accumulated by integrating various Energy Reduction Schemes (ERSs) with the MEE. Steam splitting, feed splitting, feed liquor preheating, thermo-vapor compressor, etc. are the well-known ERSs that may be incorporated with the MEE to reduce energy utilization. Hence, this study investigates the hybrid ERSs incorporated with MEE to observe their energy efficiency in an optimal manner. The prime focus of this investigation is to achieve enhanced energy efficiency in teams of maximum steam efficiency which is computed by formulating the nonlinear mathematical models of the MEE. To achieve the maximized energy efficiency, an optimization function has been developed under a constraint environment and solved by using metaheuristic-based approach named Flow Direction Algorithm. Another ERSs named flash tanks can also be integrated with this system to encourage waste heat re-utilization and ensures an increase in energy efficiency with constant steam consumption. This work also deals with the incorporation of the Linear Fresnel Reflector with ERSs integrated MEE which is capable of reducing the conventional energy load. The overall integrated MEE model achieves an energy-efficient and renewably operated MEE unit that may enhance the self-sustainability of the industry. © 2022","Energy Efficiency; Energy Reduction Schemes; Flow Direction Algorithm; Linear Fresnel Reflector; Multiple Stage Evaporator","Energy utilization; Evaporators; Optimization; Paper and pulp industry; Reflection; Sustainable development; Waste heat; Energy; Energy reduction; Energy reduction scheme; Flow direction algorithms; Fresnel reflectors; Linear fresnel; Linear fresnel reflector; Multiple stage evaporator; Multiple stages; Multiple-effect evaporator; Energy efficiency",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139423324

Moreover, research has highlighted that engagement with sustainability initiatives can be affected by people's desire to maintain aspects of their current social realities pertaining to occupations, traditions and lifestyles. Farmers are central to a sustainable agricultural transition, yet are also socially embedded in the spaces that are targeted for transformation. This article engages with this dilemma through an exploration of farmer values in an upland farming area in Ireland. Specifically, we draw on qualitative case-study data to explore how farmers value their occupation, lifestyles and social structures in terms of the relationships in which they operate. We highlight a range of dimensions through which case-study farmers value farming—especially as autonomous, outdoor work—in terms of tacit skills and knowledge, familial legacies and certain forms of social organisation. Conceptually, this article builds on calls from within social sustainability scholarship to engage with social aspects of sustainable development. We develop and deploy a relational values analytic framework, which offers a simple yet effective lens for exploring farmer values in terms of the relationships through which they are generated and articulated. Through this framework, we explore how different individuals value their farming occupations and lifestyles. Moreover, by focusing on the relational dimension, we tease out the multiple and sometimes conflicting values that individuals navigate in relation to their farming occupations. We conclude that this kind of approach could enhance understanding of farmer engagement with (or resistance to) sustainable agriculture initiatives. © 2022 The Authors.

Unlike offline PMS with prior knowledge on the load profiles, real-time PMS is more challenging because of unknown load profiles. Two typical real-time PMS methods are equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) and model prediction control (MPC). However, ECMS can only make instantaneous decisions without the ability to handle large load demand changes, and MPC normally relies on pre-defined input references to guide the optimization. To alleviate these problems, in this paper, a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based method is proposed with a reward function guided by worst-case to minimize the fuel consumption. Meanwhile, a Siamese learning-based model is integrated with MCTS to improve its performance further. To ensure the sustainability of the power for unknown profiles, a time-dependent SoC-shore constraint is introduced, which intends to fully recharge the battery when leaving each of the shore connection stations. This constraint has not been considered in the previous real-time PMS studies. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other methods on both fuel consumption minimization and the SoC-shore constraint fulfillment.

These include the environmental impact of global product procurement and manufacturing and the irregular treatment of indigenous workers in developing countries. Thus, reshoring, defined as a firm's voluntary strategy to partially or totally relocate production to the home country, is gaining traction. However, most research on reshoring focuses on firms, leaving the consumers’ perspective under-researched. Here, we examine British consumers’ perspectives on reshoring to the UK and sustainability. By employing the theoretical lens of connectedness, anchored in attachment theory, we conducted 30 in-depth interviews using projective techniques and analysed the data using the constant comparison method. We found that consumers not only positively viewed their connectedness with the concept of reshoring from a sustainability perspective, but also appraised it from a global perspective, demonstrating empathy towards the host country. Further, they doubted corporations’ motives regarding reshoring.

However, agricultural advancements detached mankind from that heritage. In U.S. Midwest, it is evident that technological advancements over the past half-century have threatened man’s survival for centuries to come. Midwest is the prime agricultural land area in North America whose recent glaciation, deep-rooted prairie vegetation, and moderate precipitation favored the development of highly productive rain-fed farming systems. Evolution of productionist paradigm in Midwest focused on crop and livestock output but also resulted in numerous environmental externalities. Massive use of agrochemicals, for instance, resulted in pollution of Mississippi River watershed from upperstream to downstream creating a hypoxic zone in Gulf of Mexico. In this situation, it is appropriate to ask what best alternatives for mankind could be to reconnect with nature to achieve sustainability. The study explored three approaches including ecological conservation, biodiversity, and agricultural education. Conservation requires the passion of humanity to reconnect with ecological community and become part of it rather than to manipulate and seek control over it to reap ecosystem services. In creating interrelated diversity through domestication of culturally important wild species, agroforestry, horticulture, animal husbandry, and inclusion of relevant language and culture we can define a sustainable world. Agricultural education brings in three tenets of teaching/learning, research/discovery, and extension/engagement to provide, create, and apply knowledge, respectively, which are important in communicating the science of sustainability. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agriculture education; biotechnology; Ecological conservation; hunter-gather heritage; interrelated biodiversity; productionist paradigm; sustainable agriculture; U.S. midwest",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139412872

In order to improve the frequency performance of the wind-dominated electricity-hydrogen systems (WEHS), this paper investigates how to analytically evaluate and implement the dynamic frequency regulation (DFR) supported by a grid-scale alkaline electrolyzer (AEL) plant. The DFR&#x0027;s potential of the AEL plant is released by an emulated power-frequency characteristic, and its contributions to improving system frequency response are also analytically evaluated from the aspects of transient, steady-state, and stability indicators. Furthermore, the DFR dependency on the frequency containment reserve provision and pre-contingency operating points of AELs are analytically clarified. A DFR-driven controller to coordinate multiple modules in the AEL plant is also designed in detail. In addition, the economic analysis is presented to evaluate the profitability of AELs providing frequency support. Cases of a simple WEHS and a modified IEEE 9-bus system integrated with grid-scale AEL plants during frequency contingencies are studied to validate the proposed DFR method, which can improve the system frequency response with smoother transients and lower steady-state deviation.

The prior research primarily relies on regulatory or non-economic measures to ensure ecological sustainability, while the role of market-based or economic measures in ecological sustainability is yet to be investigated. Hence, realizing the need for policy shift, this study is an effort to determine the dynamics between environmental taxes and ecological sustainability for the period between 1995/Q1 and 2018/Q4 using data of top-seven green economies by employing novel Quantile-on-Quantile (QQ) regression approach. The outcomes from the QQ approach indicate the mixed and asymmetric impact of the environmental taxes on ecological sustainability in sample countries over different quantiles. However, a higher ecological promoting impact is observed at upper-middle quantiles in most of the sample countries. The robustness of the study's results is validated by Quantile Regression (QR) approach and the nonparametric quantile causality test.

The feasibility of this transformation, the motivations, status and gaps, and perspectives are discussed after introducing how this change also implies a change in the model of production. Realizing the defossilization of chemical production involves electrifying the chemical processes, especially crucial elements such as chemical reactors, and the direct use of renewable energy to drive the chemical reaction. With a focus on electrocatalysis, the most relevant cases of (i) light olefin production, (ii) direct synthesis of main intermediates such as formaldehyde and acetic acid, and (iii) the production of aromatics are analyzed. The feasibility of these routes in the short-medium term is shown, while other cases such as the direct synthesis of ammonia from N2 require turning the approach to other directions. On a global scale, defossilization of chemical production is feasible in the medium-long term with a cut of over 800 Mt per year CO2 eq. emissions in line with the expectation to reach the net-zero emission target.

On Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, black bears prefer to use cavities associated with large-diameter hollow trees or structures derived from trees (i.e., cavities in or under logs, root boles and stumps) as den sites. Extensive harvesting of coastal forests has reduced the availability of natural den structures such that their supply may affect population sustainability. I attempted to develop new methods to address the declining supply of denning opportunities by creating and testing new den structures constructed in trees, stumps and from plastic. Between 2014–2021, I created or deployed and monitored 17 potential den structures in 2 study areas that were believed to have low den supply. I documented up to 51 visits by bears at each structure; every one of the video-monitored structures was investigated at least 5 times. None of the plastic artificial den structures were used by bears, but an enhanced natural structure was used as a den over 4 consecutive winters. My work indicates that bears will find and investigate all natural or artificial denning structures in their environment, but artificial structures do not appear to be a viable method to mitigate losses of dens caused by forest harvesting. © 2022 The Authors.

However, the potential toxicity and leakage of hazardous Pb species have become one of the main barriers to their large-scale application. When solar cells are subject to physical damage or failure of encapsulation, rapid leakage of Pb may occur, which can be accelerated by exposure to external environmental weathering conditions such as rainfall and elevated temperature. Herein, an in-depth investigation on the essential role of Pb in PSCs and QDSCs, as well as common causes of Pb leakage, is undertaken. The hazardous effects of Pb toxicity on soil plants, bacteria, animals, and human cells are also evaluated. Recent progress in developing effective strategies for Pb leakage reduction, such as Pb-free or Pb-less perovskite materials, device architecture design, encapsulation absorbers for PSCs, and core–shell structure and ligand exchange method for QDSCs, in addition to Pb recycling strategies of end-of-life solar cells are summarized.

It is advantageous for relevant scholars to deepen their understanding of this academic field from a bibliometrics view to grasp the future directions better. Design/methodology/approach: Structuring a citation network with the processed data set containing 866 papers and relevant information collected from Web of Science (WoS). Conducting review analyses aiming at the main paths that are extracted from the above citation network. Findings: There are two different evolution paths in LSCM field, i.e. improving corporate sustainability performance through combining lean and green practices, and seeking the balance between lean and agility to structure leagile supply chain for specific industries. LSCM research studies mainly focus on five aspects: (1) establishment and development of LSCM theory; (2) structuration of lean supply chain; (3) research studies of the relationship between LSCM and corporate performance; (4) supply chain evaluation system; and (5) review and vista of LSCM field. The intersection of two knowledge evolute routes would be Industry 4.0, which is an integrated theory system combining lean, agility, green and other supply chain thinking. Research limitations/implications: The data set collected from WoS cannot contain all the research studies about LSCM is the main research limitation. Sustainability, as represented by environmental performance, will continue to be a major pursuit of this field. Integrating LSCM in Industry 4.0 will be the next hotspot in LSCM field. Practical implications: Providing the main research contents and common methods of LSCM field. It is conducive to deepening the understanding of relevant practitioners and scholars to LSCM field from a dynamic perspective. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first time to reveal the knowledge diffuse trajectories of LSCM under different view with main path analysis.

Moreover, due to the very high demand for fuel, because most of the machines, vehicles use fuel to conduct day today activities. Due to this high demand, the price is also very high. Not only that, the burning of fossil fuel normally release carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide which are the greenhouse gases.

Methods: Using convergent mixed method design, the qualitative and quantitative data were collected from 427 nurses and nine stakeholders. This was done in one phase with the use of validated questionnaires and in-depth interview guide/key informant interview guide. Data were collected for 5 months and analyzed with SPSS version 25. Qualitative data were analyzed using themes. Results: The explored significant challenges by stakeholders and nurses to sustainability of standardized nursing care plan (SNCP) in all the selected hospitals were inadequate knowledge of standardized nursing languages (SNLs), inadequate staffing, lack of motivation, lack of mandate to use SNLs by the educational system, lack of computers on the wards, weakness of previous training on SNL/SNCP, lack of interest, and high patient load. Conclusion: The study concludes that inadequate knowledge of SNLs and inadequate staff could contribute to non sustainability of SNCP. Implications for nursing practice: Nurses should be continuously trained on standardized nursing languages. Staff motivation and increasing the number of staff on the wards would increase the interest of the nursing staff. This will in turn improve the quality of documentation and patient care. © 2022 NANDA International, Inc.","advance nursing process; Nigeria; standardized nursing language",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139400736

Recently, the boosting effect of MoS2 cocatalysts is widely recognized in Fenton reactions, and the primary mechanism is the promotion of the reduction and recycling of high-valence metal ions. Unfortunately, integrating heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts and MoS2 cocatalyst to form an efficient system remains challenging due to the severe deactivation of MoS2 and the inability of simple physical mixing to speed up the reaction. For the first time, the direct activation of commercially available bulk MoS2 powder in a durable acidic microenvironment is achieved. The foam-modified photo-Fenton catalyst (Cu-CN-ef) promotes the rapid activation and formed an ideal MoS2-excited photo-Fenton system. The significant synergistic effect of the system is ascribed to the outstanding sustainability of Cu-Mo redox cycling and favorable local acidic microenvironment on the surface of Cu-CN-ef. This system works well in outdoor cases with a tiny amount of commercially available Cu-CN/MoS2 powder, promising a new route for portable and rapid solar-powered wastewater treatment.

Internet of Things (IoT) is seen as a widely accepted technology that promotes sustainability through the interconnection of diverse computing sources for solving environmental problems. Previous studies on IoT have discussed interesting factors toward its adoption, but selecting a suitable IoT service provider (IoTSP) is an open challenge due to a diverse set of factors in practice. Driven by the challenge, in this article, a generalized fuzzy-based decision model is put forward for IoTSP selection, which is the prime objective of the study. Initially, a strength, weakness, opportunity, threat (SWOT) analysis is adopted to identify the crucial challenges in IoT adoption. Later, the relative significance of these challenges is calculated by adopting the regret&#x002F;rejoice approach. Due to uncertainty, certain rating information of IoTSPs is missing that are rationally imputed by proposing an analytical approach. Rating matrices from experts are transformed into opinion vectors, and a prioritization algorithm is developed with query vector for rational personalized ordering of IoTSPs. Data for the study are acquired via questionnaire, which is filled by experts. The efficacy of the developed model is exemplified by using a real case study of IoTSP selection for pollution management in Chennai. Concerning the findings, mobility, security, and connectivity are the most vital factors for IoTSP selection. Results show that the proposed model is a viable tool for IoTSP selection and it is robust, unique, and stable compared to its counterparts.

Besides, textile effluents are discharged into rivers or wetlands without proper treatment in many cases. Untreated textile effluent can contaminate groundwater and water bodies, reduce dissolved oxygen in the water, and affect aquatic ecosystems, which may indirectly cause climate change. The waste generated in dyeing is mainly due to the cleaning process. Thus, the dyeing process needs to be improved and optimized to solve the problem and reduce delay. To take effective measures for future improvement, it is essential to develop a nature-inspired tracking system. The amount of emission and the performance can be improved by utilizing scheduling as a tool. In this view, the dyeing process is formulated as a bi-objective optimization model to reduce the tardiness cost and minimize the emission of wastewater during the cleaning process of the dyeing vat. The current problem is of a difficult nature; thus, multi-objective particle swarm optimization in collaboration with the tabu search algorithm has been used to attain good and nondominant results. The tabu search algorithm is used along with ejection chains to focus on the objectives of emission reduction and increase the number of desired solutions. It was found that the total processing time was reduced by 4–5 hours and water was reduced by 500 liters for dyeing 200 kg of yarn daily. © The Author(s) 2022.","particle swarm optimization; tabu search; Textile sector; waste","Aquatic ecosystems; Biomimetics; Cleaning; Dissolved oxygen; Effluents; Learning algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Tabu search; Textile industry; Textiles; Water treatment; Cleaning process; Cloth production; Dyeing process; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm optimization; Tabu search algorithms; Textile effluent; Textile sector; Textile wet process; Groundwater",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139390831

Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of Australian listed firms from 2011 to 2021, the authors perform textual analysis on sustainability practices from annual reports and sustainability report disclosures and include this variable in various regression models that assess firm valuation. The authors also use propensity score matching and Heckman two-stage regression methodology to address endogeneity concerns. Findings: The authors find that firms disclosing sustainability practices exhibit higher market valuations relative to other firms. Specifically, loss-making firms exhibit higher market valuation during the COVID-19 crisis relative to prior period. The authors also observe a negative association between sustainability practices and firm performance proxied by return on assets. The findings suggest that engagement in sustainable practices helps loss-making firms remain resilient during the pandemic. In addition, the authors find that the positive relation between sustainability practices and firm value is stronger among firms with a higher level of annual report readability. Originality/value: Considering the conflicting evidence in the literature on the economic benefits of sustainability practices, this study takes advantage of the heterogeneity in corporate practices and provides empirical evidence that a firm’s sustainability practices can build economic resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

With the emergence of markets for baobab products, a central concern is to confirm whether use patterns differ across different tenure regimes and, if so, their ecological outcomes. The study is based on an ecological survey in Zimbabwe of 244 baobab trees located across three tenure regimes – communal, private and state – and also draws on interviews with key informants. The results suggest that tenure has a strong influence on the sustainability of baobab harvesting. Based on identified parameters of ecological sustainability, trees under state tenure were shown to be harvested unsustainably, and showed excessive bark harvesting, while those under private and communal tenure had fewer signs of debarking and produced more fruits, suggesting their use was more sustainable. Excessive bark harvesting was found to negatively affect fruit and bark production and, to a lesser extent, the overall health of the tree.

These healthcare services are based on a variety of diverse requirements. Fulfilling these requirements require proactive intelligent analytics and self-sustainability of networks. Self-sustainability enables the operation of a network with minimum possible interaction from the end-users/network operators, whereas proactive intelligent analytics enables efficient management of resources in response to users&#x0027; requests. To enable healthcare 4.0 with proactive online analytics and self-sustainability, one can leverage digital twins. In this article, we present an overview and recent advances of digital twins for healthcare 4.0. An architecture of digital twins for healthcare is also proposed. Furthermore, we present several use cases of digital twins. Finally, we present open research challenges with possible solutions.

Propylene carbonate (PC) proves to be a competitive solvent with the high permittivity and wide-liquid range, while the application is intrinsically hindered by the poor graphite compatibility and high viscosity. Here, a PC-based electrolyte with wide-temperature range is developed by tuning the strength and topology of the Li+-PC interactions via non-solvating interactions without altering the solvation structure. Thus, the problem of graphite exfoliation caused by Li+-PC co-intercalation can be successfully mitigated. Consequently, such electrolyte shows compatibility with both graphite and high-nickel cathode, exhibiting an expanded liquid range from −90 to 90 °C. This work, breaking from the traditional EC-based formula, provides a new strategy for designing PC-enabled electrolyte featuring high performance, wide-temperature compatibility, and sustainability. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","lithium-ion batteries; molecular interactions; PC-based electrolytes; solvation structures; wide-temperature electrolytes","Electrolytes; Graphite; Ions; Lithium compounds; Propylene; Solvation; Sustainable development; Carbonate-based electrolytes; Environmental adaptability; High permittivity; Li +; Liquid range; Long term stability; Propylene carbonate; Propylene carbonate-based electrolyte; Solvation structure; Wide-temperature electrolyte; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139388825

The impetus of this study is the expansion of the UK Stewardship Code across a broader range of asset classes, stewardship activities, and topics. The code has moved away from the traditional focus on shareholders by adding investors in other assets to the list of the stewards of corporate activities. Also, the revised concept of stewardship covers broader topics, including environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors.

Materials and Methods: A comparative life cycle analysis was conducted based on an individual person using inter-dental cleaning aids every day for 5 years. The primary outcome was a life cycle impact assessment. This comprised of 16 discrete measures of environmental sustainability (known as impact categories), for example, greenhouse gas emissions (measured in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent, or kg CO2e), ozone layer depletion (measured in kilograms of chloroflurocarbon equivalent, or kg CFCe), and water use (measured in cubic metres). Secondary outcomes included normalized data, disability-adjusted life years, and contribution analysis. Results: Inter-dental cleaning using floss picks had the largest environmental footprint in 13 of 16 impact categories. Depending on the environmental impact category measured, the smallest environmental footprint came from daily inter-dental cleaning with either bamboo inter-dental brushes (five impact categories, including carbon footprint), replaceable head inter-dental brushes (four impact categories), regular floss (three impact categories), sponge floss (three impact categories), and bamboo floss (one impact category). Conclusions: Daily cleaning with inter-dental cleaning aids has an environmental footprint that varies depending on the product used.

The third section considers the current exemplar of convergence as a new dynamic of fundamental and applied research then challenges the premise translation is a one-way transfer and application of findings from one domain to another, thereby recognizing complexity of relational capital, platforms as sites of collaboration, and ensuing tensions.

In contrast to most supply chain management (SCM) research, which has typically focused on the dominant focal companies’ perspective, this qualitative research examines how suppliers’ SIs are diffused along textile and cosmetics SCs. Drawing on practice-based studies and the diffusion of innovation theory, we identify SI diffusion as a practice that comprises three sequential activities (presenting, evaluating and implementing). By conceiving of SI diffusion as a practice, we demonstrate that each of these activities is articulated around practical understanding, ends and emotions. This study contributes to the literature by answering different calls to integrate other theories into the SCM field and to move away from the taken-for-granted meaning of practices. Moreover, it sheds light on suppliers as initiators of SI diffusion. Finally, our main contribution is the focus on emotions in the diffusion process. More specifically, we reveal that sustainability, practices and emotions cannot be dissociated, extending current SCM studies that have focused on the rational dimension. © 2022 Kedge Business School.","diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory; emotions; practice theories; supplier perspective; supply chain; Sustainable innovations; teleo-affective structures",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139383760

It is frequently administered as IV piggyback with a pump, carrier fluid, and tubing. The Established Status Epilepticus Treatment Trial demonstrated levetiracetam being similarly effective to previously used treatments in doses up to 4500 mg administered over 10 minutes. Objective: We sought to compare usage, cost, and waste of IV piggyback with IV push administration of levetiractam following implementation of an IV push protocol in an academic emergency department. Methods: A three-month review of levetiracetam administration was done following protocol implementation using IV push for initial treatment of benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus. The review quantified the number of IV push vs IV piggyback doses for all indications and evaluated cost of supplies necessary for administration. Results: During the study period, 137 patients received 142 doses of IV levetiracetam. Fifty-one doses (36%) were given as IV push rather than IV piggyback. The majority of doses 116 (82%) were 1000-2000 mg and 11 doses (8%) 3500-4500 mg. Estimated three-month savings with complete transition of IV piggyback to IV push would exceed $6000 just in our ED. The amount of sterile solution carrier fluid was also reduced and IV pump time freed. Conclusion: Implementation of an emergency department IV push levetiracetam protocol resulted in cost savings.

In addition, numerous agrochemicals presently being used as fertilizers and pesticides have low efficiency and high toxicity. However, the rapid growth of nanotechnology has shown great promise to tackle these issues replacing conventional agriculture industries. Since the last decade, nanomaterials especially metal oxide nanoparticles (MONPs) have been attractive for improving agricultural outcomes due to their large surface area, higher chemical/thermal stability and tunable unique physicochemical characteristics. Further, to achieve sustainability, researchers have been extensively working on ecological and cost-effective biological approaches to synthesize MONPs. Hereby, we have elaborated on recent successful biosynthesis methods using various plants/microbes. Furthermore, we have elucidated different mechanisms for the interaction of MONPs with plants, including their uptake/translocation/internalization, photosynthesis, antioxidant activity, and gene alteration, which could revolutionize crop productivity/yield through increased nutrient amount, photosynthesis rate, antioxidative enzyme level, and gene upregulations. Besides, we have briefly discussed about functionalization of MONPs and their application in agricultural-waste-management. We have further illuminated recent developments of various MONPs (Fe2O3/ZnO/CuO/Al2O3/TiO2/MnO2) as nanofertilizers, nanopesticides and antimicrobial agents and their implications for enhanced plant growth and pest/disease management. Moreover, the potential use of MONPs as nanobiosensors for detecting nutrients/pathogens/toxins and safeguarding plant/soil health is also illuminated. Overall, this review attempts to provide a clear insight into the latest advances in biosynthesized MONPs for sustainable crop production, protection and management and their scope in the upcoming future of eco-friendly agricultural nanotechnology. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Antioxidants; Biochemistry; Chemical stability; Crop protection; Cultivation; Genes; Hematite; Metal nanoparticles; Metals; Microorganisms; Nutrients; Photosynthesis; Sustainable development; 'current; Agricultural sector; Climatic conditions; Crop managements; Crop production; Crop protection; Food demand; Metal oxide nanoparticles; Protection and management; Sustainable agriculture; Cost effectiveness; agricultural chemical; antioxidant; fertilizer; manganese derivative; metal nanoparticle; oxide; pesticide; zinc oxide; agriculture; crop production; nanotechnology; procedures; soil; Agriculture; Agrochemicals; Antioxidants; Crop Production; Fertilizers; Manganese Compounds; Metal Nanoparticles; Nanotechnology; Oxides; Pesticides; Soil; Zinc Oxide",Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139379166

This study aimed to assess compliance with IF fast-day calorie restriction and whether 5-2 IF leads to reduced overall energy intake, weight loss and compensatory increased energy intake on non-fast days. Method: Participants completed diet diaries at baseline and 28 days post 5-2 IF in a repeated measures within-subjects design. 5-2 IF required restricted energy intake to 500 kcal/day (women), 650 kcal/day (men) on two ‘fast’ days/week whilst eating ad-libitum on other days. Results: 52 participants were included (n = 42 female; age 44 ± 11.2yrs). Median weight loss after 28 days 5–2 IF was not statistically significant (1.8 [-2 - 7.3 IQR = 2.2]kg; 2.8 [-2.7–11.2 IQR = 2.5]%). There was a significant reduction in total energy intake during 5–2 IF compared with pre-diet (median 1288.0 [IQR 423.8]kcal and median 1751.5 [IQR 505.3]kcal respectively, p < 0.001). Carbohydrate, protein and fat consumption proportionately reduced during 5–2 IF. Participants had significantly higher energy intake (p < 0.001) on non-fast days that followed a fast day (1928.4 ± 711.9 kcal) compared to non-fast days not following a fast day (1316.2 ± 310.0 kcal). 55.8% complied with fast day calorie restrictions. Conclusion: 5-2 IF was associated with reduced energy intake, but insignificant weight loss over a 28-day period. Compliance rate was lower than most previous studies. Participants had significantly higher energy intake on non-fast days following fast days suggesting fasting may lead to over-compensation. Further research should investigate strategies to improve compliance and long-term sustainability of IF diets. © 2022 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism","Continuous energy restriction; Dieting; Intermittent energy restriction; Intermittent fasting; Weight loss",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139354596

The importance of water resources and the expectations of billions of people with serious water shortages and subsequent food shortages have made European water policy makers focus all their attention on the sustainability of water as a resource. In this paper we propose a new Water Sustainability Indicator based on a Multi-Reference methodology (WSI-MR) which permits modeling compensation between the analyzed criteria and provides a participative approach. The WSI-MR provides results based on 19 variables grouped into 5 dimensions: availability, access, resilience, good governance and economic capacity. The indicator was applied to assess water sustainability in 27 European countries. The results showed that Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom obtained the best global results in terms of weak water (compensatory) sustainability. Using a non-compensatory approach, no country gained acceptable results in terms of strong sustainability. Some subdimensions related to climate change and the state of freshwater resources were detected as especially vulnerable in all the analyzed countries. Finally, the study identified some eastern European countries with low GDP and good performance of availability and cost of water, where bad results in terms of governance and water productivity could jeopardize water sustainability in the event of a potential economic development, if these limitations are not addressed. In a context of economic and political instability, due to the current armed conflict in nearby countries such as Ukraine, it is especially important to pay attention to these countries, whose good governance indicators could worsen even more. The proposed indicator is useful to identify warning signs and can contribute to the improvement in decision-making processes and to monitoring international water policies. © 2022 The Authors","Decision-making policies; Europe; Flexible compensatory composite indicators; Governance; Multi-reference methodology; Water sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139351099

Handicrafts' Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have an expanding market in developed countries. The impact of the pandemic on this industry is severe due to the industry's informal nature and seasonal demand. The survival and resilience of these handicraft MSMEs face many challenges in the post-COVID-19 outbreak. The focus of the present study is to understand and analyze the key challenges for building resilience in handicraft MSMEs by scrutinizing the existing literature and interactions with stakeholders. EFA and the Grey DEMATEL approach are used to analyze the challenges for the adoption of resilience. EFA is used to categorize the challenges into various dimensions. The study has divided the challenges for the inclusion of resilience into survivable, sustainable, and viable categories using EFA to plan for short- and long-term business growth. Grey DEMATEL is being utilized for understanding these contextual relationships for each resilience dimension. Grey systems theory is a methodology that enables the incorporation of improbability and vagueness into the analysis. Findings of the study revealed the influencing challenges for each of the dimensions such as competition from machine-made products, insufficient government support and incentives for export, and inefficient managerial concern and response to internationalization as the prominent challenges. The results of this study illustrate the causal relationships amongst the identified resilience challenges to the various stakeholders. These findings offer practical insights for the government to allocate resources and impose measures to ensure resilience, as well as understanding the cause-effect relationship. Managerial implications and Policy insights for building the resilience of handicraft MSMEs are discussed in detail. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Exploratory factor analysis; Grey DEMATEL; Handicraft industry; India; Resilience; Sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139348176

Resilience for Agri-Food Supply Chain (AFSC) is the capability of the supply network to manage and mitigate disruptions due to global warming and natural phenomena such as landslides and floods of crops, among others caused by humans. A significant challenge is to design efficient and resilient AFSCs in emerging countries while perishability constraints are considered. A methodology to design an AFSC for emerging countries is addressed in this research. The phenomena that aid in identifying critical aspects of the AFSC affecting their resilience are identified. The former approach combines optimization and simulation schemes by considering resilience metrics related to availability and connectivity. Indeed, the solution approach addresses the uncertainty by using simulation of disruptive events and finding resilient designs using mathematical programming. The proposed framework has been evaluated in a Colombian coffee supply chain. The obtained results show the efficiency of the proposed scheme to design AFSCs and allow the practitioners to measure, predict, compare, and improve the level of resilience of their supply chains (SCs). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Agri-food supply chains; Availability; Connectivity; Optimization; Risk management; Supply chain resilience",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139334757

SSAs find themselves operating in mature markets characterized by increased competition by larger ski areas and multi-resort ski conglomerates. Due to their smaller size they have strategic disadvantages, which makes precise positioning in the market and added value creation for their customers necessary. This study examines strategies of SSAs by exploring the influence of different governance structures. Using a comparative case study approach to gain an in-depth understanding of strategies of SSAs, this paper examines two SSAs with different governance structures, one in the U.S. and one in Europe. Data gathering includes nineteen in-depth interviews with various stakeholders of both SSAs, archival data, and on-site observations. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis. The findings highlight three core differentiating factors: (1) technology and innovation, (2) market positioning, and (3) communication and collaboration with stakeholders. While both SSAs pursue a differentiation strategy and target similar groups of customers, they apply different segmentation and marketing strategies, climate change adaptation measures, and service offerings. The findings contribute to the development and management of SSAs as they explain different strategies regarding innovation, market positioning and collaboration with stakeholders due to contrasting governance structures and highlight stakeholders’ awareness to climate change and sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Case study approach; Destination governance; Innovation and technology; Market positioning; Small ski areas; Stakeholder management",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139334453

An assessment of its habitat is needed to maintain the conservation, especially for the forage plants consume. Therefore, this study aims to determine the types, abundance, and diversity of the available forage plants for Anoa in the Abdul Latief Forest Park. The study was carried out using checkered lines with a descriptive approach in three blocks, including station I as protection block, station II as utilization block, and station III as collection block. The checkered line method contains three repetitions in three blocks with a total area of 1.8 ha. Data analysis was carried out using the Shannon-Wienner variability formula, Margalef wealth index, Evenness abundance, and dominance index. Based on the results, six plants were identified as Anoa feed, including Ficus racemosa L., Elatostema integrifolium (D. Don) Wedd., Nephrolepis sp., Begonia sp., Scleria multifoliata Boeck., and Alpinia sp. Furthermore, the leaf is the most consumed part of the plant by Anoa, and the E. integrifolium (D. Don) Wedd. is the forage plant with the highest abundance value of 49,167 (ind ha−1) in the protection block. Meanwhile, for the diversity value, each block was in a low category at 0.88, 1.28, and 1.44, respectively. Based on the index value of species wealth, the highest value was observed in the collection block; hence more species were discovered in this block than the other two blocks. However, Elatostema integrifolium (D. Don) Wedd. showed a dominance index in the protection block.

Especially in the case of fast food, capturing the vegan and vegetarian market may serve to help these primarily meat-based businesses expand their operations and possibly increase overall meat consumption. © 2022 Koninklijke Brill NV.","fast-food; Paperless office; plant-based; sustainability; vegan",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139314612

But its uncontrolled and inappropriate usage with subsequent discharge has resulted in contamination of water bodies. It is known to pose serious threat to human well-being and to the aquatic community on account of its toxic nature. Adsorption on account of its ease of operation, cost-effectiveness and environment friendliness is recognized as one of the best tertiary treatment methods and hence can be recommended for the eradication of PQ from aqueous water bodies. The utilization of adsorbent materials with reasonable and eco-accommodating attributes is a possible answer for getting safe water. To maintain sustainability, a nanocomposite of hydroxyapatite and magnetite (NC) was fabricated and its adsorption potential for the eradication of PQ was evaluated. NC was characterised using FTIR and XRD methods. Batch adsorption studies were carried out to evaluate the extent of adsorption. For the adsorption of PQ onto NC, the effects of operating parameters such as pH, adsorbent dose, initial adsorbate concentration, contact time, and temperature were also investigated. The Langmuir model best fit the adsorption data, and the maximum adsorption capacity for PQ at 25 °C was 416.67 mg/g. The dynamics of the process were best explained by a pseudo-first order kinetic model. According to kinetic studies, equilibrium was reached within 130 min of contact time in which approximately 90 % of PQ was eradicated. Adsorption of PQ onto NC was found to be a favourable, spontaneous, and exothermic reaction by thermodynamic analysis. The present study thus demonstrates the effectiveness of fabricated nanocomposite for the eradication of PQ from aqueous solution. © 2022","Adsorption; Chitosan; Hydroxyapatite; Magnetite; Nano-bio composite; Paraquat","Aquatic organisms; Cost effectiveness; Fabrication; Herbicides; Hydroxyapatite; Kinetic theory; Magnetite; Nanocomposites; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Adsorption studies; Agricultural practices; Aquatic communities; Broad spectrum; Contact time; High productivity; Nano bio composites; Paraquat; Waterbodies; Well being; Adsorption",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139282804

The impacts of land preparation methods on soil C accruals and C alterations under two predominant rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) based agroforestry systems viz. rubber–pineapple and rubber–banana in the Western Ghats region of Kerala, India, were highlighted in this study. Soil samples were collected from each agroforestry system at two depths (0–30 and 30–60 cm) after the complete harvest of the intercrops and analysed for total carbon (TC), organic carbon (OC), inorganic carbon, oxidizable OC fractions (F1, F2, F3 and F4) and C in water stable aggregates. Tilling of rubber inter-rows for pineapple planting with earth movers reduced 18% of TC and OC and 23% of SOC stock in the upper 30 cm soil layer. Even though the high amount of soil C was lost during tillage, the high and diverse organic matter turnover in the rubber–pineapple system reduced the negative impact of tillage on soil quality. With respect to the rubber–banana system around 13% increase in TC and OC and 11% increase in SOC stock was observed compared to monoculture rubber. The high litter turnover contributed to greater soil C, indicating high C sequestration potential of both agroforestry systems. The study also advocates the importance and need of reorientation of land management strategies for rubber agroforestry systems to attain global food security and C sustainability from a climate change perspective. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Agroforestry systems; Carbon sequestration; Hevea brasiliensis; Land preparation methods; Soil carbon pools; Water stable aggregates",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139267629

The study attempts to assess the deleterious impact of municipal solid waste (MSW) dump on surrounding forested landscape by employing geospatial technologies, which are cost and time-effective. For this purpose, temporal period ranging from 2015 to 2020, having 41 valid satellite observations has been selected for study. Firstly, the radii of intense hazardous zone and hazardous zone have been measured, as two separate parameters, which are 580 ± 30 m and 1260 ± 30 m, respectively. Secondly, average spatial extent of bio-influence zone is measured to be 1262 m while the average thermal influence zone extends up to 530 m around the MSW dumping site. A detailed analysis of influence zone variations reveals that the bio-influence zone depends on multitude of meteorological parameters, whereas the thermal influence zone relies mainly on seasonal temperature fluctuations. Moreover, the level of severity of emissions from MSW decomposition directly depends upon temperature. The long-term variability analysis of these hazardous zones reveals the stationarity of their spatial extents, signifying forest resilience. This study has proved significance of geospatial techniques as an alternate of expensive and time intensive assessment methods involving in situ measurements. So the proposed technique is beneficial for environmentalists, decision-makers and municipal authorities for analysing the extent and severity of MSW pollutants for forest community to address the problem of ecological degradation. © The Author(s) 2022.","forest community; geospatial technologies; hazardous zones; meteorological parameters; Municipal solid waste; thermal influence zone","Decision making; Forestry; Hazards; Sustainable development; Forest community; Geo-spatial; Geospatial technology; Hazardous zone; Influence zones; Meteorological parameters; Spatial extent; Thermal influence; Thermal influence zone; Waste dumps; Municipal solid waste; article; decomposition; dumping; environmentalist; forest; human; meteorology; municipal solid waste; solid waste",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139267594

We frame our study within the organizational category theory, using Morningstar Direct data to analyze the category of investment funds declaring sustainability objectives–SFDR Article 9– and a control group with no sustainability objectives–SFDR Article 6. We assess how investment managers are financially incentivized to achieve either sustainability or financial objectives.

When companies enter new foreign markets or expand their sales into existing ones they can be subject to increased formal and informal pressures. I show, theoretically and empirically, that in these cases the informal pressures' tacit and experiential nature affects the timing and the likelihood of compliance with these pressures. First, compliance with informal pressures takes longer than for formal ones. Second, companies that cannot afford learning about informal pressures, because of resource constraints or a limited learning efficiency due to a narrow previous international experience, tend to forgo compliance with these pressures. Failure to comply with these pressures or to do so in a timely manner can have devastating consequences for internationalizing companies' legitimacy. © 2022 The Author","Informal institutional pressures; Institutional theory; Internationalization process; Legitimacy; Sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139262806

The meta-cognitive role of CW to better promote healthy eating attitude and behavior is relevant and underexplored. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 310 young consumers through an online survey. Reliability and validity were established using confirmatory factor analysis, and hypotheses were analyzed through structural equation modeling using MPlus V8.3. Findings: The results reveal that HFA has a positive influence on all dimensions of CW: responsibility, purpose, perspective, reasoning and sustainability. All dimensions but one augment a positive healthy eating attitude, but only responsibility and sustainability enhance consumers’ self-regulatory success. The findings show that HFA does not directly prevent obesity, but CW mediates the relationship between that advertising and obesity prevention. These findings show that CW establishes a mindful connection between HFA and obesity control. Research limitations/implications: This research extends the theory of CW in the context of healthful eating and contributes significantly to the advertising, hospitality and obesity literature. Practical implications: This study also has implications for multiple stakeholders, including consumers, restaurant operators, hospitality managers, brand managers, the government and society in general. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study marks the first attempt to investigate the role of CW in preventing obesity.

Aims: (i) To establish a baseline clinical profile of patients with frailty; (ii) To obtain a representative cross-sectional view of patients with frailty and their acute inpatient clinical management; (iii) To determine the rate and clinical outcomes of frailty among hospitalised patients. Methods: The study will be conducted in a Western Sydney tertiary teaching hospital (Blacktown and Mount Druitt Hospital), serving a large socio-economically diverse, multi-cultural community. A long-term, prospective observational clinical cohort of patients who are admitted under Rehabilitation and Aged Care Services over the next 5-year period (2020–25) will be conducted. Frailty will be assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale, and the FI-ED frailty instrument, performance will be assessed using the Australian-modified Karnofsky Performance Status (AKPS). Participants will be followed-up at 3, 6, and 12 months by telephone, following their index hospitalisation. Outcomes of interest include all-cause rehospitalisation (including emergency department presentation), mortality and admission to residential aged care service over the period of 12 months. Data Linkage endpoint assessment will be undertaken at 1, 2, and 5 years. Discussion: Frailty is an emergent area of clinical and research interest. It is an important prognostic indicator of mortality, rehospitalisation and institutionalisation. Conclusion: This study will provide longitudinal data to demonstrate short, mid, or long-term outcomes of hospitalised frail older adults. Data will be used to inform future studies and quality improvement activities. Impact: It is envisioned that the registry will act as a spine project for future multi-disciplinary research opportunities including interventional studies, data linkage studies and quality improvement projects, thus enabling robust medium – long term examination of outcomes of interest, such as mortality, rehospitalisation and admission to residential aged care within this area of growing concern. There are plans to engage more disciplines in the registry's research capacity-building endeavours and we have identified the need for greater consumer engagement and public involvement. The sustainability of the registry needs to be considered within the context of ongoing research funding and making better use of these data for continuous quality improvement.

A total of 1091 documents are reviewed and bibliometric analysis is used with two approaches: data analysis and conceptual structure of the field. Additionally, a classification into 12 categories by topic is proposed. The results show that more than 40% of the publications belong to analysis of classical investment tools with a gradual evolution towards the concept of “green” instruments. Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) strategies have changed over time from “screening” to the current “best-in-class”, “Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) integration” and “impact investing.” The results of the study are valuable for academics and practitioners, as they show the current state of knowledge, evolution paths and emerging topics. © 2022 The Authors.

In response, experts argue that our clothing needs to have a longer life. However, not all items of clothing can be used for a long period of time. Children’s clothing, for example, can quickly become obsolete, creating a waste issue. To explore this issue further, we examine the Swedish childrenswear market and how designing for the circular economy can address this market segment’s unique sustainability challenges. Rather than centering on a consumer perspective, we investigate the role of design in supporting the transition to a more circular children’s clothing industry. As a key contribution, this article demonstrates that there are more circular design strategies available than prior research has explicitly mentioned. In particular, we show how design for longevity and design for neutrality can help to overcome some of the sustainability challenges facing the industry. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","children’s wear; circular economy; fashion; sustainability; Sweden",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139257302

Building from two European-level science–policy workshops, this perspective essay discusses the types of risks involved with such sustainability reporting. The analysis is rooted in the framework of the UN 2030 Agenda and sustainable development goals (SDG). As a globally adopted framework, it provides an example of how risks are either recognised and framed, or non-recognised. Well recognised risks include data availability for SDGs and siloed preparation of indicators, while risks receiving less attention are ritualistic reporting lacking a critical evaluation of the limitations of the SDG framework itself. These different risks are likely to reinforce each other. A specific risk is a too narrow focus on one-way communication aiming to inform individual policy decisions. Risks related to SDGs are best managed with iterative, integrative and interactive knowledge production fostering holistic understanding. © 2022, The Author(s).","Agenda 2030; Indicators; Risk management; Risk perceptions; Sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139256256

As a sustainable approach, low-cost and abundant biomass materials are promising candidates to prepare porous carbon for capacitive deionization. In this work, binder-free porous carbon sheets are successfully prepared using natural balsa, pine, and basswood by thermal carbonization and treated by chemical activation. The carbon electrode materials converted from balsa and pine exhibit a comparable salt adsorption performance by capacitive deionization due to the extensive surface area, substantial electrical property, and superior hydrophilic performance. The following activation treatment of the balsa-converted carbon further enhances the surface and electrical properties and benefits the desalination performance. The salt adsorption capacity of the activated balsa electrode exhibits 12.45 mg g−1. Additionally, 19.52 mg g−1 Pb2+ and 20.06 mg g−1 Cr3+ heavy metal adsorption capacity is also observed with the activated balsa electrode in 100 mg L−1 PbCl2 and 50 mg L−1 CrCl3, respectively. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the highest NaCl adsorption capacity performance reported thus far by using pure wood converted carbon as the electrode, and these promising results indicate that activated balsa is an extraordinary material for water desalination. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","binder-free; chemical-activated carbon; sustainability; water desalination; wood","Activated carbon; Adsorption; Carbonization; Chemical activation; Chromium compounds; Desalination; Electrodes; Energy efficiency; Heavy metals; Lead compounds; Porous materials; Water filtration; Adsorption capacities; Binder free; Capacitive deionization; Carbon electrode; Chemical activated carbon; Desalination technologies; Energy efficient; Performance; Porous carbons; Water desalination; Sodium chloride",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139254706

Climate change has emerged as one of the key stressors threatening coral reefs and their fish-associated services. How fish nutrient concentrations respond to warming oceans remains unclear but these responses are probably affected by both direct (metabolism and trophodynamics) and indirect (habitat and species range shifts) effects. Climate-driven coral habitat loss can cause changes in fish abundance and biomass, revealing potential winners and losers among major fisheries targets that can be predicted using ecological indicators and biological traits. A critical next step is to extend research focused on the quantity of available food (fish biomass) to also consider its nutritional quality, which is relevant to progress in the fields of food security and malnutrition. Biological traits are robust predictors of fish nutrient content and thus potentially indicate how climate-driven changes are expected to impact nutrient availability within future food webs on coral reefs. Here, we outline future research priorities and an anticipatory framework towards sustainable reef fisheries contributing to nutrition-sensitive food systems in a warming ocean. © 2022, Springer Nature Limited.",,,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139254437

Allahabad Safeda) and sapota (Manilkara achras Mill. cv. Cricket Ball) orchards was investigated. Besides, the soil quality of the orchards was compared against an adjacent forest soil (AFS, considered a baseline ecosystem). Values of pH, SOC, porosity, PHA, DHA, GSA, ExCa, ExMg, and DTPA-Cu were significantly lower in drip circle soils relative to inter-row space soils. The extent of reduction was prominent in older orchards. There was a significant building up of BD, AvP, AvK, DTPA-Fe, and DTPA-Zn in drip circle soils relative to inter-row space soils. The soil variability between drip circles and inter-row spaces across the soil depths was significant (p < 0.01). Principal component analysis (PCA) plots were generated to determine the variability of soil quality among orchards and AFS. Long-term soil management (18–40 years) induced soil spatial variability within the orchards. Analysis of similarity showed a significant difference in variability of soil quality within an orchard, among the orchard types, and between the orchards and the AFS. Except for soil AvK, all soil quality attributes maintained a significant correlation with the PC-axis-1 (p < 0.05 and 0.01) that explained maximum variability (40.2%–49.4%). The DHA and SOC contributed the maximum variability (r = 0.95 and 0.92, respectively with PC axis-1).

Modern and efficient tactics are required to boost agricultural output beyond facing stresses. Recently, many studies reported that nanotechnology can enhance plant growth and development under stress and non-stress conditions, contributing to agricultural sustainability. Seed priming with nanoparticles (NPs) is a modern and effective approach that increases germination, plant growth progression, productivity, and postharvest physiology of plants by regulating morphological and physio-biochemical characteristics. Different plant studies showed that seed priming with NPs enhances germination, improves nutrient uptake, regulates antioxidant defense, and reduces oxidative damage under stress and non-stress conditions. Recently, several reviews on the regulatory role of nanotechnology on plant growth progressions have been published. However, the regulatory roles of nano-seed priming have not been reviewed adequately and systematically.

The ability to forecast energy demands, energy obtained from renewable resources and their impacts on the environment and society is extremely important for an effective energy planning and policy making. However, it is a complicated issue requiring many factors, which are rarely independent and often not well defined in real-world problems, to be considered. Moreover, this planning process may require the evaluation of uncertain scenarios arising from different economic, regulatory, technological and environmental advancements. Therefore, in this study, an approach consisting of fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM), weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) and impact effort assessment is introduced to enable experts to rank different sustainability scenarios based on their impact and the effort needed. By using this approach, the scenarios with less effort and relatively high impact are identified for an effective energy planning. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Energy capacity investments; Energy planning; Fuzzy cognitive mapping; Scenario analysis",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139253121

One of the most polluting sectors is the fashion industry. Fashion brands often decline responsibility, and continue misleading or exaggerated communication. This study aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of regulation in the fashion industry and show practices of fashion firms. Design/methodology/approach: Based on documentary analysis and literature review, the article describes current civil, supranational and governmental policies aiming to enhance the three dimensions of sustainability. Connecting these to the high-growth firm theory, the authors present a case study of a rising Hungarian fashion star based on press, sustainability and balance-sheet report analysis and personal interviews. Findings: The article highlights some problematic areas of sustainability and greenwashing and describes the different levels and targeted areas of regulation. From the entrepreneurial perspective, the difficult balancing among growth and sustainability is analyzed and illustrated by the detailed case study. The authors provide regulatory suggestions (including the creation of a supranational monitoring agency). Practical implications: Even if the authors doubt that global fashion chains can be sustainable, they offer both managerial and policy suggestions to reach the highest level of sustainability. Social implications: The suggested measures can contribute to the more sustainable practices and fraud reduction in the fashion industry. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the economic-regulatory approach used in this study to sustainable fashion industry is new, such as the presentation of the practices of a high-growth firm with a sustainable image. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Fashion industry; Greenwashing; High-growth firms; Sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139252493

Findings arising from this study are summarized as follows: firstly, that energy transition is negatively responsive to monetization ratio and positively responsive to bank development. Secondly, that energy transition is a response to increasing emissions in the studied countries. In addition, it was discovered that the greater the degree of energy intensity (energy inefficiency), the higher the need for energy transition. Energy sources whose intensity vary inversely with productive activities are recommended for SSA countries.

Through a series of experimental tests, the efficacy of fiber-reinforced slag geopolymer binder in stabilizing soft clay was investigated. The focus of the experimental program is to evaluate the strength performance of soft clay stabilized with slag geopolymer binder with and without fibers. The variables adopted in this investigation are alkali to binder ratio, binder content, and fiber dosage. Considering the multiple parameters involved in the unreinforced treated specimens, the test results were plotted using MATLAB after optimizing the experimental results using response surface method. Regression equations were obtained for the variation of unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and flexural strength with alkali to binder ratio and binder content. The error was found to be in the acceptable range. Stabilization of soft clay with fiber-reinforced geopolymer binder has improved both UCS and flexural strength properties when compared against unreinforced geopolymer stabilized soft clay. Based on the findings of this experimental study, it can be noticed that polypropylene fiber-reinforced slag geopolymer binder stabilized soft soil with an A/B ratio of 1.0 and at 30% binder content with a fiber dosage of 0.5% by dry weight of soil exhibited peak strength values. According to the findings of this study, fiber-reinforced slag geopolymer can be effectively utilized as a sustainable alternative to the conventional stabilization materials or binders for improving the engineering properties of soft clays. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Fiber-reinforced geopolymer binder; Flexural strength; Ground granulated blast furnace slag; Response surface method; Soft soil; Unconfined compressive strength",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139248530

Few studies have examined empirically and theoretically the relationship between technological innovation and ecological footprint in conjunction with other factors, such as the human capital index and renewable energy sources, such as biofuels and nuclear power. This study examines the impact of technological innovation on G-7 countries’ ecological footprints from 1990 to 2020. A cross-sectionally augmented autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) model is used in the study. The results of the study show that technological innovation minimizes the ecological footprint. A lower ecological footprint is also associated with increased usage of human capital and renewable energy. Depletion of the natural environment is a short-term and long-term consequence of increased GDP growth. Our results confirm that ecologically sustainable technology enhances the quality of the environment. Consistent panel causality results were achieved.

EMIC waves observed on the ground are the manifestation of their generation in the Earth's inner magnetosphere. With the spacecraft measurements, it is difficult to determine their spatio-temporal extent and sustainability. In this context, in addition to the spacecraft observations the ground observations can give better insights into these features. We have identified the long-duration EMIC wave events observed at the subauroal station Maitri during 2011–2017. We have found a total of 12 EMIC wave events that are steadily observed for >10 h. The start times of these events are identified between 1.4–9.3 LT hours, and they lasted for 10–18 h. All these events are dominantly seen during the recovery phase of the weak-moderate geomagnetic storm. Comparison with spacecraft observations indicate the simultaneous EMIC waves in the magnetosphere within L–shell 4–6 with wider longitudinal coverage, and sufficiently long time presence in the magnetosphere.

This study uses the framework of social motivation theory to achieve the objective. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a qualitative research design by taking the case of Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. Using purposive sampling, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 37 respondents, and themes were drawn manually. Findings: The analysis found four themes that create a good crowding effect among domestic tourists, namely, convenience and price; familiarity and place attachment; social affiliation; and safety. The themes indicated that despite the pandemic, and constant occurrences of new variants, Indian domestic tourists’ on-site attitude towards crowding was favourable. Research limitations/implications: Firstly, the good crowding effect during the pandemic could have been better understood using empirical data. Secondly, the results cannot be generalized, specifically for developed economies. Practical implications: This study offers practical implications to destination managers and local administrative bodies for whom achieving sustainability in urban tourism has always been concerning. These include developing infrastructural facilities, encouraging cultural activities in city centres and improving the perception of safety to sustain the good crowding effect. Social implications: The affective dimension involved in making a travelling decision played a significant role in the post-pandemic phase. While suppliers needed survival, tourists needed social affiliation and escape from the mandated home isolation due to multiple phases of COVID-19 lockdown in India. This study adds value to society by emphasising that the need for social affiliation among travellers remains intact, and the tourism industry should embrace this transformation. Originality/value: While most of the pandemic-related studies criticised crowd and tourists’ crowd averting behaviour, this study reported that the good crowding effect could also be an outcome owing to different factors. Therefore, this study offers distinctive nuance of tourists’ behaviour in the post-COVID-19 phase, allowing destination managers and tourism stakeholders to re-think their strategies. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19; Crowding perception; Domestic travellers; Good crowding; India; Social motivation theory; Urban destination",,Note,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139241082

There is an excellent appetite for DTs in developing countries like India, and initiatives such as Digital India have transformed business to a more sustainable dimension. Encouraged to adopt DTs, industries identify practical barriers at the social, environmental and economic levels. Although the literature provides discussion on these barriers, a rational prioritization is lacking. To circumvent the problem, a fuzzy decision model is put forward. Firstly, the barriers affecting DT adoption are reviewed and industry experts can rate the barriers after that.

This is achieved using a topic model based on automated language processing. Subsequently, we use a Seemingly Unrelated Regression model, applied to manufacturers' operational data, to establish the degree of alignment between sustainability strategies and operations. Results show that sustainability in the automotive sector is highly differentiated and manufacturers emphasize diverging topics in their communication strategy and have different production practices.

It allows organic substance to be recovered and reintegrated into the soil, thus preventing erosion phenomena, increasing the biological fertility of the soil, and contributing significantly to the restoration of impoverished sites. Modern winegrowing must address the issue of vineyard fertility in the sustainability context. The goal of this study was to assess the advantages of distributing a sustainable product to the vineyard that can achieve vine balance (vegetative and productive equilibrium). In a Vitis Vinifera L. Sangiovese cv., vineyard, four soil treatments were applied (three compost rates and a control): municipal solid waste compost (40 tons per hectare - MSW40, 15 tons per hectare - MSW15, 2.5 tons per hectare - MSW2.5), and no compost (CTRL). The vine physiology (leaf gas exchange and water potential) and berry compositions (phenolic and technological maturity) were studied during the 2018 2019 growing seasons in the Sieci area, Italy. The results of this experiment provide some general insights showing that MSW compost options can be expected to reduce water stress, balanced vine performance, and provide sustainable recirculation of organic matter.

The blockchain-based circular economy is being used in many industries worldwide, but Indian electronic MSMEs face many problems in adopting a blockchain-based circular economy. The research aims to discover the barriers the electronic MSMEs face in adopting a blockchain-based circular economy and pull back from achieving environmental sustainability in their operations. Design/methodology/approach: Fifteen barriers are identified from the literature review and finalized with experts' opinions. These barriers are evaluated by using interpretive structural modeling (ISM), MICMAC analysis and fuzzy TOPSIS method. Findings: Lack of support from distribution channels, lack of traceability mechanism and customer attitudes toward purchasing remanufactured goods are identified as the most critical barriers. Practical implications: The study will benchmark the electronic MSMEs in achieving environmental sustainability in the blockchain-based circular economy. Originality/value: It is a study that not only establishes a hierarchical relationship among the barriers of blockchain adoption in Indian electronic MSMEs but also verifies the results with fuzzy TOPSIS method. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Barriers; Blockchain; Circular economy (CE); Environmental sustainability; Fuzzy TOPSIS; MSMEs",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139233212

Mismanagement of the generated solid waste has a negative impact on the public health and the environment. Effective recycling of solid waste is considered as one of the various approaches to overcome these problems. The review aims to provide an overview of the prevailing waste management scenarios across the globe and highlight the importance of recycling. The review assessed the key criteria of municipal solid waste management, and it includes a complete assessment of municipal solid waste creation, characterization, collection, and disposal in India. The inherent issues and driving possible solutions for successful solid waste management are examined. Unsorted garbage at the source, social hurdles, public perception, a lack of knowledge, unplanned expenditures, and inadequate execution of government laws were noted as the problems with solid waste management. The review found that the geographical position and economic status of a nation are important in dictating waste characteristics, and identified the recycling potential of solid waste. The review concluded that the various characterization techniques are important for the development of value-added products produced through the recycling of solid waste. Moreover, the review suggested the adoption of an integrated waste management approach for the socio-economic environmental development of nations. The findings and discussions of the review will help the relevant authorities for municipal solid waste management and researchers develop more efficient strategies for successful municipal solid waste management.

Four pump tests were implemented in the 2016 summer low-flow period to measure groundwater pumping effects to Chemainus River surface water flow and temperature. The effect of pumping on surface flow was estimated using four metrics based on differences between measured and predicted flow at a hydrometric gauge located 340 m from the groundwater wells. Differences were estimated as residuals from a regression model relating flow at this gauge to flow at a gauge 1.3 km upstream of the wells. The effect of pumping on surface water temperature was assessed using daily maximum and daily average water temperature at gauges located 340 m and 1.4 km downstream of the wells. An effect of pumping on river flow was measurable when the pumps were turned on and shut off. The consistency of measured effects across all tests and the absence of discernable trends within and across tests indicate that the average effect of pumping across a broader period is equivalent to the average of all before and after comparisons, which was estimated as 9.9 L/s ± 12.1 L/s, or 5.5% of river discharge at the time of the tests. Groundwater pumping did not result in a detectable shift in water temperature. The results indicate that changes in water temperature in relation to the pump tests were smaller in magnitude or spatial scale than the detection limits of the implemented experimental design. This case study provides an example of quantification of pumping effects on stream flow and temperature, as required by the Water Sustainability Act for licensing of groundwater abstraction. We suggest this approach could be used elsewhere to quantify effects of groundwater abstraction. © 2022 Canadian Water Resources Association.","Groundwater abstraction; groundwater-surface water hydraulic connectivity; pump test; river temperature; stream flow","Aquatic organisms; Gages; Groundwater; Hydraulics; Pumps; Regression analysis; Rivers; Stream flow; Water levels; Groundwater abstraction; Groundwater pumping; Groundwater-surface water hydraulic connectivity; Groundwater-surface waters; Hydraulic connectivity; Pump tests; Pumping effect; River temperature; Water hydraulics; Water temperatures; Water temperature",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139227580

The key motivation for using non-conventional components was the scarcity of natural resources and their high costs, which drove the trend toward using waste materials in asphalt pavement construction to achieve environmental sustainability. This paper aims to provide an overview of the effect of adding waste vegetable oil (WVO) to asphalt binders and asphalt concrete mixtures. The information was obtained from several Scopus database studies conducted over the period of 2005 to 2022 and was used to evaluate the performance of asphalt under different dosages of WVO. It was concluded that almost all the researchers reached an agreement that adding WVO to the asphalt reduces the softening point, viscosity, complex modulus, creep stiffness, the resistance to deformation, and elastic recovery quality of asphalt. On the other hand, it increases its penetration, ductility, phase angle, m value, stress relaxation characteristic, and thermal cracking resistance. For asphalt mixtures, it was found that adding WVO increases the flow value and Voids in Mineral Aggregate (VMA). In contrast, it reduces stability and the air voids in the mixture. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Chinese Society of Pavement Engineering.","Asphalt concrete mixture; Bio-asphalt; Marshall test; Recyclability; Superpave test; Waste vegetable oil","Asphalt concrete; Asphalt pavements; Binders; Concrete mixtures; Creep; Stress relaxation; Sustainable development; Vegetable oils; Asphalt cements; Asphalt concrete mixtures; Bio-asphalt; Marshall test; Pavement industry; Property; Recyclability; Roadway constructions; Superpave test; Waste vegetable oil; Mixtures",Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139226413

With tweets like this questioning brands’ policies, activists advocating for sustainable fashion re-discuss material starting points that are assumed by fashion brands, who argue that they are sustainable because they care about their workers’ conditions. This paper argues that activists use tweets to open subdiscussions on material starting points to engage citizens and consumers, re-discussing factual data that brands take for granted, such as the fact that they provide fair conditions for their garment workers. Activists justify their opening of subdiscussions, often through an argumentative pattern that includes an argument based on the locus from effects to cause. They argue that if there are negative effects, the brand cannot claim to care about the conditions of its workers. In discussing how subdiscussions are used by fashion activists, this paper also introduces a conceptualization of Twitter argumentation as a discussion that is not isolated, but is part of a polylogical argumentation that takes place in different venues. For this reason, the argumentation used in tweets is reconstructed as a response to a fashion brand’s communication campaigns around sustainability, which extend beyond the confines of Twitter. As an empirical illustration, this paper is based on the campaign targeting fashion retailer Primark; the dataset includes the brand’s website as well as activists’ tweets. © 2022, The Author(s).","Locus from effect to cause; Material starting points; Polylogue; SUBDIMA; Subdiscussions; Twitter",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139224281

Two US high school science teachers and an engineering technology teacher sustained implementation of an integrated STEM curriculum after the conclusion of the funded program, TRAILS. Class observations were conducted to examine how the teachers implemented the integrated STEM curriculum and how they maintained integrated STEM teaching in a science and engineering technology education (ETE) teacher pair using science and engineering technology shared practices. After the integrated STEM lesson, their students’ academic achievements were compared to those of the students who previously participated in the project. The results reveal that the students showed no difference from the previous TRAILS students in terms of academic achievements as measured by STEM knowledge test scores, which may indicate that the teachers successfully maintained consistency and effectiveness of the implementation. Additionally, a twenty-first century skills survey was newly conducted to examine students’ growth in confidence in twenty-first century skills after they were taught the integrated STEM lesson. The students showed increased confidence in critical thinking, which indicates that the students benefitted from the teachers’ instructions even after the conclusion of the funded program and the absence of support. Based on the findings from the teachers’ experiences of multiple years of integrated STEM teaching, the study discusses how to better support teachers for the successful implementation of an integrated STEM curriculum as a sustainable education program in secondary schools. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Community of practice; Integrated STEM; Shared practice; Sustainability","Curricula; Education computing; Engineering education; Sustainable development; Academic achievements; Communities of Practice; Education programmes; Higher School; Integrated STEM; Science and engineering technologies; Secondary schools; Shared practice; STEM education; Teachers'; Students",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139223921

It aims at comparing established and less developed technologies regarding their prospective value added in a country. This is done by classifying a technology’s value added to the developed categories: domestic, potential domestic and non-domestic. Within this paper, two methods for assessing this indicator are introduced focussing on their applicability in a sustainability assessment context. Both methods are tested on a case study comparing two alternative drivetrain technologies for the passenger car sector (battery and fuel cell electric vehicle) to the conventionally used internal combustion engine. The first method is life cycle cost-based whereas the second is based on Input Output analysis. If a life cycle cost assessment is already available for the technology under assessment, the easier to implement life cycle cost-based approach is recommended, as the results are similar to the more complex Input Output-based approach. From the ‘domestic value added’ perspective, the battery electric vehicle is already more advantageous than the conventional internal combustion engine over the lifecycle. Fuel cell electric vehicles have the highest potential to increase their ‘domestic value added’ share in the future. This paper broadens the economic pillar in sustainability assessment by introducing a new indicator ‘domestic value added’ and giving practical information on how to prospectively assess it for existing and less developed technologies or innovations.

Design/methodology/approach: A longitudinal fieldwork case study was conducted from 2014 to 2019 in a Chinese central state-owned enterprise (CSOE), a pioneer in sustainability reporting practice since the mid-2000s, to collect first-hand empirical data on managerial perceptions of the adoption of external SRA. Semi-structured interviews with 25 managers involved in sustainability (reporting) practice were conducted. The interview data were triangulated with an analysis of archival documents and board meeting minutes pertaining to the undertakings of sustainability practices in the case study organization. Findings: Our empirical analysis suggests that while managers recognize the benefits of adopting external SRA in enhancing the legitimacy of sustainability accountability, they oppose SRA because of their deep-rooted allegiance to the dominant logic of sociopolitical stability in China. SRA is envisaged to risk the stability of the socialist ideology with which CSOEs are imbued. Therefore, any transformational approach to accepting a novel (foreign) practice must be molded to gain control and autonomy, thereby maintain the hegemony of stability logic. Instead of disregarding external verification, managers of our case SOE appear to harness sustainability reporting as a navigational space to engage in internally crafted alternative manners in order to resist the rationality of SRA. Originality/value: The empirical analysis presents a nuanced explanation as to why internal managers have hitherto been reluctant to embrace the embedding of independent assurance into the sustainability reporting process. Our prolonged fieldwork provides ample context-specific, intra-organizational evidence regarding the absence of SRA in Chinese CSOEs, which warrants more attention given their considerable presence in the global economy. In addition, the empirical analysis contributes to our understanding of the managerial capture of sustainability issues in a specific context of state capitalism and how organizations and individuals in an authoritarian regime interpret and respond to novel discourses derived from distinct institutional settings. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Case study; Chinese CSOEs; Navigational space; Resistance to assurance; Socio-political stability logic; Sustainability reporting assurance",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139223007

In addition, the ecological background has spatial continuity that is not limited by boundaries, and the radiation effect areas extending beyond ECR areas have not been quantified. In this study, the Beijing ECR areas and ecological security network were integrated in order to connect the ecological process and landscape pattern to the ECR through the circulation path of ecological corridors, and cross-boundary effects between patches were examined. The field spread model was used to quantify the radiation influence range of ECR areas. Additionally, 972.46 km of ecological corridors were identified in Beijing, and abundant corridors effectively linked the ECR areas and maintained the material cycle. In the surrounding areas, ecological corridors were spread radially, with a total length of 941.85 km, promoting cross-boundary ecological flow between the ECR and surrounding source areas. This study used 25 ecological nodes to constitute the cross-boundary ecological security network system. The total radiation area based on the ECR source was 9572.16 km2.

In this paper, indicators related to land use transitions, including the regional eco-environmental quality index (EV), the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI), and soil erosion, are selected to analyze the eco-environmental quality of Erhai Lake Basin from 2000 to 2020. The results showed that (1) from 2000 to 2020, forestland, grassland, and cultivated land were the major land use types in the study region, and also the land use types where land use transition was notable; (2) over the 20 years of study, the EV value of Erhai Lake Basin increased by 0.003, its average RSEI increased by 0.14, and the average soil erosion modulus there decreased by 15.48 t/(km2·a), indicating that the eco-environment of the Erhai Lake Basin was improving. Evaluation based on multiple ecological indicators was superior to assessment relying on single indicators; (3) all three ecological indicators showed that the ecological environment of the basin was improving, but with significant regional differences. Forestland had the best ecological quality, while unused land and built-up land had the worst. RSEI was more regionally adaptable than the other two indices. (4) The transition of cultivated land into other land use types was the main reason for the improved ecological quality in the basin, while tourism had accelerated land use transformation. Compared with assessment based on single ecological indicators, evaluation based on a combination of multiple ecological indicators can more accurately reflect the ecological condition of the study area and provide a basis for eco-environmental protection in Erhai Lake Basin. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Erhai Lake Basin; EV; Land use transition; RSEI; Soil erosion; Spatial and temporal changes",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139219901

Nowadays, wine is still an important sector in terms of land use and income source in many countries, more specifically in the European Mediterranean region. However, to control pests and regulate wine growth, the extensive use of pesticides is common. The effects and persistence of agrochemicals in the environment is well known and defined in scientific literature as well as the environmental and human health risks of these compounds. The purpose of this review was to do a state of art of worldwide production of academic literature using bibliometric principles and analysis to identify thematic areas of this type of agriculture, and its challenges in a changing world. For this review, the focus is on current practices to see what may evolve for more sustainable viticulture. It was found that the three main producers of wine, i.e., Spain, France, and Italy, are also three top producers of scientific literature on this topic. The use of bibliometric methodologies defined the main thematic areas on this subject as follows: soil–plant transfer of agrochemicals, heavy metal accumulation in vineyard soils, management practices in viticulture, water pollution transport, effects of viticulture on the living part of soil, sustainable alternatives to pesticides. We found that Spain, France, and Italy work the most on developing sustainable alternatives for agricultural practices; however, sustainable alternatives and practices were also the least developed thematic in general. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Copper accumulation; Soil pollution; Sustainability; Transfer of pollutants; Viticulture",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139219794

Method: A comprehensive literature review around alkyl polyglucosides (APGs) and sucrose esters (SEs) as bio-based surfactants, through the lens of the 12 green chemistry principles was conducted. An overview of the use of bio-based surfactants in personal care products was also provided. Results: Bio-based surfactants are derived primarily from natural sources (i.e. both the head and tail molecular group). One of the more common types of bio-based surfactants are those with carbohydrate head groups, where alkyl polyglucosides (APGs) and sucrose esters (SEs) lead this sub-category. As global regulations and user mandate for sustainability and safety increase, evidence to further support these bio-based surfactants as alternatives to their petrochemical counterparts is advantageous. Use of the green chemistry framework is a suitable way to do this. While many of the discussed principles are enforced industrially, others have only yet been applied at a laboratory scale or are not apparent in literature. Conclusion: Many of the principles of green chemistry are currently used in the synthesis of APGs and SEs. These and other bio-based surfactants should, therefore, be considered suitable and sustainable alternatives to conventional surfactants. To further encourage the use of these novel surfactants, industry must make an effort to implement and improve the use of the remaining principles at a commercial level.

How has sustainability become an issue of interest to accounting standard-setters? And how do accounting standards intend to contribute to the environmental economic transition? Scholars of international political economy and cognate fields have devoted little attention to the study of international accounting standards, particularly in relations to sustainability. Drawing on a set of qualitative data and an interdisciplinary literature on finance and financialisation, this article first argues that accounting standard-setters’ interest in sustainability is the result of the incremental transformation of environmental issues into meaningful information for investors’ decision-making. Secondly, it shows that these standards and their development are based on the premise that the environmental economic transition depends on the provision of information that primarily meets the needs of investors, contrasting starkly with the original underpinnings of sustainability accounting.

In the future, the electrification of transportation will reduce the requirement of existing fuel stations, thereby rendering them obsolete. However, they are best suited to cater to the charging demand of EVs as the drivers are accustomed to the locations and the incremental cost of providing this service will be lower. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to assess the techno-economic feasibility of retrofitting an existing fuel station with EV charging infrastructure also known as Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). To further enhance the value proposition, the potential of integrating Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) with EV charging infrastructure, which results in the reduction of grid connection costs, is studied. The sustainability of the proposed system is improved with additional onsite Photovoltaic (PV) generation. The proposed methodology is implemented for the UK as a case study. The configurations in this study are designed based on the technical considerations involved in retrofitting a typical fuel station as a fast charging facility for EVs. From the results, it is observed that the configurations with 4 EVSE, 1 BESS, and 8 h of operation and the configuration with 4 EVSE, 1 BESS, and 1 PV system for 8 h of operation are economically viable. The abovementioned configurations are the most economically feasible configurations in terms of the Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and the Discounted Payback Period (DPP) amongst the other configurations considered in this study. The proposed methodology indicates that though the connection cost is the dominant factor affecting the feasibility, the use of BESS with or without PV can reduce the connection cost by almost 90% depending on the capacity of BESS. The methodology acts as a decision support tool to select a techno-economically feasible configuration of EVSE, BESS, and PV.

Next, we analyzed the events using a four-pillar sustainability model, which consisted of the economic, social, environmental, and ethical pillars. We detected several contextually relevant and dynamic pivotal factors related to each of the pillars, which had effects on the sustainability of the program at the time of the critical events. The analysis revealed that positive pivotal factors in one sustainability pillar can be used to compensate for negative pivotal factors in the other pillars. Two aspects that were crucial for the sustainability of the online doctoral study program were the resilience and shared commitment of the community involved in its activities, which helped in overcoming any challenges encountered. Based on this study, we recommended that future research should design novel solutions that help online study programs to proactively identify potential critical events and related pivotal factors.

Despite this domain gaining prolific attention recently, issues hampering the effective utilization of residues from fish processing usually go unidentified in developing economies such as India. This occurs mainly owing to fragmented supply chains, inappropriate handling, discontinuous cold chains, inadequate temperature monitoring and so on, affecting quality and causing underuse. Any researcher trying to understand the prospects of utilizing these fish processing co-streams in a developing economy with the vision of improving consumption, economic sustainability, reducing discards and promoting circularity faces a lacuna. The authors address this demand in research by identifying the validity of this domain both in the global and native research community by conducting a detailed review using bibliometric analysis and content analysis. Data from Scopus with 717 documents, comprising 612 research articles from 78 countries, 1597 organizations and 2587 authors, are analysed. Results signify (i) developing a focus on hydroxyapatite production, bio-methane generation, transesterification processes, biomass and the rest raw material generated from fish processing, and (ii) reduced research on supply chain-related aspects despite their considerable importance. To comprehend this deficiency, especially in the Indian stance, barriers hindering the utilization of generated by-products are identified, and recommendations for improvements are proposed. The results will provide the struts for a circular and sustainable supply chain for processed seafood in developing economies. © The Author(s) 2022.","bibliometric analysis; Food waste; processing co-streams; supply chain; waste management","Fish; Hydroxyapatite; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Bibliometrics analysis; Cold chain; Developing economies; Fish processing; Fish wastes; Food loss; Food waste; Processing co-stream; Socio-economics; Utilization of residues; Waste management",Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139201848

Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts an interpretive approach and draws on a qualitative dataset derived from interviews, documentary analysis and observation. Findings: The paper traces how the Corporate Reporting Dialogue was orchestrated by the International Integrated Reporting Council, with the objective of aligning sustainability reporting standards, but moved to become a vehicle for orchestrating standards consistent with the recommendations of the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosure. Collaboration between the Dialogue's five most active bodies forged the blueprint adopted by the International Sustainability Standards Board's vision of sustainability reporting that prioritised reporting only on those socio-ecological issues deemed to materially affect future enterprise value. Originality/value: The paper explicates the role of collaborative initiatives in the standardisation of sustainability reporting and shows how these initiatives act as vehicles to subtly undermine the GRI position (presented as one standardiser amongst many whose vision appears as an outlier, despite its position as the dominant sustainability reporting standardiser), and establish the prioritisation of a sustainability reporting worldview based on investor-oriented enterprise value creation. The case also draws attention to the specific orchestrators involved in establishing this prioritisation, and reveals the influence of philanthropic foundations. In doing so, it extends our understanding of legitimacy generation in standard-setting by showing how collaborative initiatives offer private standardisers another means to generate input legitimacy for what, in this case, represented a vision of reporting at odds with most sustainability reporting practice. Finally, the paper extends the sites of power to collaborative initiatives and details the mechanisms through which covert power is exercised but also masked where orchestrators use convening power, funding and membership choices to define the boundaries of discussion by influencing who participates, what is on the agenda and what activity is undertaken. Rather than viewing standardisation as a simple pursuit of conquest between individual standardisers, the paper considers how collaboration provides the opportunity for assimilation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","International Sustainability Standards Board; Non-financial reporting; Orchestration; Power; Standard-setting; Sustainability reporting",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139199408

To measure the extent of sustainable practices at the firm level, the Comprehensive Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) score is proposed. The indicator, computed using the Mazziotta-Pareto method, combines qualitative ratings on adherence to ESG standards with quantitative observations on the extent of data disclosure. Firms failing to pursue full disclosure are penalized. Focusing on the constituents of the Euro Stoxx 300 index, a dynamic panel model is implemented, where profitability is explained by the indicator. The results show that sustainability in business practices reduces profitability. These findings are in line with a strand of literature that highlights the role of strategic disclosure of ESG information on part of firms. Strategic disclosure occurs as a combination of greenwashing and social washing, with firms overstating the extent of their positive behaviors. The integration of sustainable practices within successful business models thus remains a relevant societal problem.

However, the significance of proline accumulation for drought stress tolerance remains enigmatic in crop plants. First, we examined the natural variation of the pyrolline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS1) among 49 barley genotypes. Allele mining identified a previously unknown allelic series that showed polymorphisms at 42 cis-elements across the P5CS1 promoter. Selected haplotypes had quantitative variation in P5CS1 gene expression and proline accumulation, putatively influenced by both abscisic acid-dependent and independent pathways under drought stress. Next, we introgressed the P5CS1 allele from a high proline accumulating wild barley accession ISR42-8 into cultivar Scarlett developing a near-isogenic line (NIL-143). NIL-143 accumulated higher proline concentrations than Scarlett under drought stress at seedling and reproductive stages. Under drought stress, NIL-143 showed less pigment damage, sustained photosynthetic health, and higher drought stress recovery compared to Scarlett. Further, the drought-induced damage to yield-related traits, mainly thousand-grain weight, was lower in NIL-143 compared with Scarlett in field conditions. Our data uncovered new variants of the P5CS1 promoter and the significance of the increased proline accumulation regulated by the P5CS1 allele of ISR42-8 in drought stress tolerance and yield stability in barley. © 2022 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: This study compares the theory with other popular theories to explain pro-environmental behaviour and behaviour change and systematically review 25 empirical research studies that adopt the goal-framing theory. Findings: Most studies rely on survey data, focus on Europe and gather self-reported behaviours or hypothetical responses. Furthermore, many studies of goal frames neglect key situational factors. Thus, the directions for further research outlined herein emphasise the need for more experimental studies of real behaviours, with consideration of situational factors, using methods that can explicate unconscious processes too. Overall, goal-framing theory provides a promising approach for analysing pro-environmental behaviours, in that it explicitly deals with goal conflicts, takes situational factors into account and encompasses conscious and unconscious processes. The authors conclude that the theory can form a useful basis for the design of social marketing behavioural interventions to promote pro-environmental behaviours. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, as the first systematic review of empirical applications of goal-framing theory, this study provides refinement and validation. By also offering propositions and a research agenda, the authors hope to inspire researchers in social marketing to address the remaining gaps and refine the theory even further. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Goal-framing theory; Motivation; Pro-environmental behaviour; Systematic literature review; Theory-based review",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139195210

However, the literature is undecided about the effects of communicating one's corporate social responsibility activities to consumers. This raises the question of how sustainability-driven companies can best advertise their products to stimulate ethical consumption: using self-benefit frames, where the main beneficiary is the consumer, or using other-benefit frames, where the main beneficiary is a third party. Using three experiments, this study examines the effect of other-benefit (vs. self-benefit) advertising frames on consumers' impulse purchases from sustainability-driven companies. Increasing impulse purchases can help such companies to strengthen their competitive positions. Additionally, the extent to which the two types of justifications (moral vs. deservingness) explain the proposed effect of advertising frames. The results show that only other-benefit frames affect impulse buying behavior, both directly, as mediated by moral justification. This study's insights may help sustainability-driven companies to decide on their advertising strategies by providing evidence that other-benefit-framed advertisements are more effective in enhancing impulse purchases than self-benefit-framed advertisements. © 2022 The Authors.

These conflicts remain a major hurdle in sustaining water resources, which should be addressed using sustainable development concepts. A non-cooperative game model is developed to address these conflicts and to reduce the stress on an aquifer in the arid zone using sustainable development criteria (environmental, social, and economic dimensions). The multi-indicator game model extends the asymmetric Nash bargaining solution for solving conflicts using aquifer sustainability and socioeconomic indicators as satisfaction indicators for water resources managers and the farmers, respectively. Quantitative and qualitative sustainability indicators were assessed for aquifer restoration strategies. A social satisfaction indicator was also evaluated for each strategy by using a questionnaire. Groundwater withdrawal reduction, improving the artificial recharging system, optimizing the cropping pattern, and combining these strategies in two states with and without financial incentives to the farmers were assessed using a non-cooperative game to restore the aquifer. The strategy of optimizing the cropping pattern and the combined strategy of a 1% reduction in groundwater withdrawal and improving the artificial recharging were the first and second priorities, respectively. In the selected strategy, quantitative sustainability indictor, qualitative sustainability indicator and economical indictor were obtained for the government 0.53, 0.08 and 0.69 respectively. In this strategy, social satisfaction and economic indicators were 0.7 and 0.71 for farmers. The sensitivity analysis of the developed game model showed that by increasing the power of water resource managers, the groundwater withdrawal reduction strategies become the equilibrium point for the conflict solution. This result can be used to resolve conflicts and to achieve quantitative and qualitative sustainability in aquifer management. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Aquifer restoration; Asymmetric Nash; Groundwater management; Multi-indicator game model; Sustainability of aquifer","Agriculture; Game theory; Groundwater resources; Managers; Planning; Recharging (underground waters); Restoration; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Water management; Aquifer restoration; Asymmetric nash; Game models; Groundwater management; Groundwater withdrawal; Multi-indicator game model; Noncooperative game; Sustainability indicators; Sustainability of aquifer; Waters resources; Aquifers",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139193815

Wise water management practices to address water security issues typically require data derived from a combination of observation and model data. This data has historically proven difficult to sustainably supply in many areas of the world. We present the design and development of a global, modeled streamflow data source for the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) Global Water Sustainability (GEOGloWS) implemented at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). This GEOGloWS ECMWF Streamflow Service (GEOGloWS Service) is a solution and prototype to sustainably address this need for data. The GEOGloWS Service centralizes computing and human resources to build a global hydrologic model and exposes data and mapping web services that allow users to consume the resulting data to meet their specific needs. The global hydrologic model produces global 15-day ensemble streamflow forecasts and a historical simulation since January 1979. We present case studies in several countries and research environments which demonstrate the utility of the approach taken by the GEOGloWS Service.

The present study aims to find out the key determinants of food grain yield (FGY) and examine the role of climate change and agricultural subsidy (SUB) in the context of India using annually data spanning from 1991 to 2018. The current study applied the ARDL modelling to investigate the impacts of climatic factors (average rainfall (RF), mean temperature (AT), and carbon emission (CO2) and agricultural subsidy (SUB) on food grain yield (FGY) in the short-and long-term in India. The estimated outcomes indicate that climatic factors such as RF have a positive impact while AT and CO2 have a negative effect on FGY. Similarly, non-climate variables such as gross capital formation (GCF) and fertilizer usage (FERT) positively contributed to FGY, while the area under crop (LUC), SUB, and employment (AL) negatively affected FGY in India. The results from Granger causality divulge that climatic and non-climatic elements are the main determinants of food grain yield, which have been playing play a significant role in enhancing food grain production and ensuring food security in India. Based on empirical outcomes and findings, some key policy implications emerged. Precisely, government and policy developers should focus on technological innovation and precision agriculture to increase agriculture production and productivity. Government should create funds to curb the climate change problem and promote eco-friendly renewable energy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Agricultural subsidy; Climate hazard; Environmental regulations; Food grain; India; Non-climatic factors",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139192825

Empirical research, however, shows that management accountants are scarcely involved in sustainability accounting. This paper contributes to understanding their barriers, using path dependence theory as a theoretical framework to empirically investigate how accountants have become “locked in” by self-reinforcing mechanisms. Based on semistructured interviews with 33 management accountants in Germany, the paper identifies three interrelated self-reinforcing mechanisms that inhibit accountants from sustainability involvement. A strong focus on financial priorities and incremental improvements driven by top management expectations hinder the consideration of sustainability beyond its direct costs. Specialization is another barrier, as is an understanding of sustainability as peripheral rather than a core business. Contrary to prior literature, accountants express eagerness to learn, though rarely about sustainability. They rarely question assumptions about sustainability and their role, leading to missed opportunities for double-loop learning and more transformative change. © 2022 The Authors.

Achieving sustainable development has become the common aspiration of the international communities. In recent years, sustainability issues are gaining increasing prominence for cities to formulate long-term development strategies. The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) urban agglomeration, one of China’s most developed and densely populated industrial areas, has encountered environmental problems. Assessment of city sustainability of the YRD is a prominent issue in the process of urban construction. The paper used multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) framework to evaluate the sustainability level of 26 cities in the YRD by selecting 24 indicators from the economic, social, and environmental dimensions. In the weighting process, the paper proposed a new subjective and objective integrated weighting method based on stochastic simulation techniques. Relative results including pairwise priority matrix (PPM), comprehensive priority index (CPI), and the most likely ranking were obtained to reflect the superiority degree between two cities by adequate comparisons. The assessment results indicate that all the cities showed an upward trend from 2015 to 2019. Shanghai had overwhelming advantages over the other cities. The CPIs of Suzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi, Changzhou in Jiangsu province, and Hangzhou, Ningbo, Zhoushan in Zhejiang province were above 50 in 2015 and increased to over 85 in 2019. Additionally, most cities had unbalanced development on the three dimensions. Each city should firstly pay more attention to their own weak points, and then achieve balanced development and long-term sustainability. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","integrated weighting method; stochastic simulation techniques; Sustainability; sustainability assessment; the Yangtze River Delta Urban agglomeration",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139180469

Design: A before and after implementation, observational study. Methods: 105,437 admissions were extracted at an admission record level. Data was extracted from 1st September 2018 through to the 31st August 2019. Results: Using SQUIRE guidelines to report the study, insufficient evidence was found to reject a null hypothesis with a chi-squared test of association between in-hospital death and the NSF intervention period, with a p-value of.091. However, trends were seen in the data, which suggested a positive association. Conclusion: The NSF is a complex intervention, which provides direction for improvements but requires further research to understand the benefits for nurses, Midwives, Health Visitors and patients. © 2022 The Authors.

These tailings are either piled up or stored in a dam, where both alternatives of disposal lead to environmental impacts. The dam copper tailings have a huge potential for by-product production thus improving sustainability and profitability in industrial operations. This paper describes a study aiming at producing a magnetite pellet feed as a by-product from a dam chalcopyrite flotation tailings and generating free magnetite non-magnetic rougher tailings. The chemical assay and mineralogy analysis of dam copper flotation tailings indicate low Fe grade (6.34 wt%), high SiO2 grade (63.14 wt%), low magnetite (3.6 wt%), and high iron silicates content (22.72 wt%). The complex mineralogy of these tailings leads to the need of grinding the rougher magnetite pellet feed as fine as 80% of particles smaller than 20 µm (P80) aiming at improving magnetite liberation. The proposed process route comprises a scalping screen, low field rougher, and cleaner magnetic separations using a drum magnetic separator (80 kA/m or 1000 Gauss), followed by silicates reverse cationic flotation as a recleaner step. With this process route, it was possible to produce a high-quality magnetite pellet feed reaching 68.00 wt% of Fe, 2.13 wt% of SiO2, 0.51 wt% of Al2O3, and 95.1 wt% of magnetite. The Blaine specific surface area was 2300 cm2/g, being in the range recommended for pelletizing (1900 up to 3000 cm2/g). The total mass, Fe, SiO2, Al2O3, and magnetite recoveries were 2.77%, 29.71%, 0.09%, 0.12%, and 73.17%, respectively. Most of the magnetite losses, around 20% of total magnetite fed, occurred in the oversize of the scalping screen. Additionally, it generated non-magnetic rougher tailings with less than 1.0 wt% of magnetite that could be used as by-products and reduced the amount of tailings disposal in a dam. This study contributes toward the sustainability of operation, minimizing tailings disposal.

Human satisfaction is connected with comfort level in several aspects, including thermal, physical, psychological, and personnel. Such a relation required a comprehensive and integrated vision to be analysed in general and in conservative culture as Jordan in specific. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the impact of buildings’ setbacks on thermal comfort and visual privacy for residential development, which has been classified into four categories based on assigned land use. Field observation and spatial analysis were done for the research setting. The relation between thermal comfort and visual privacy in a detached house was tested by using primary data that was conducted through an online survey from 254 respondents. Research data were analysed using multinomial regression analysis showing that the level of satisfaction correlates with setbacks; a higher level of satisfaction resulted from better thermal comfort and visual privacy with larger setbacks. However, this contradicts principles of sustainability that appreciate intensification guidelines to reduce sprawl. So, there is a need to revise building codes to improve the level of satisfaction and well-being. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","building’s setbacks; detached house; Satisfaction; thermal comfort; visual privacy","Building codes; Houses; Land use; Laws and legislation; Regression analysis; Surveys; Sustainable development; Building regulations; Building’s setback; Built environment; Comfort level; Detached house; Direct impact; Level of satisfaction; Satisfaction; Thermal; Visual privacy; Thermal comfort",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139177210

Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling was utilized for hypotheses testing of a survey data set of 387 at healthcare organizations operating in Iraq. The data were collected using purposive sampling with expert judgment from senior managers and professionals. Findings: Contrary to previous studies, the findings showed that only green human and relational capitals predict green performance and only green human capital predicted economic performance. GAC was related to green human capital, green structural capital and performance, and played a significant mediating role on the relationships. Research limitations/implications: Even though the research was limited to one region of a single country, Iraq, GAC can be modified by managers to enhance GIC for sustainable healthcare performance. This action must be viewed in terms of the future timing of the impact while managers display strong conviction for sustainability commitment.

Relevant indicators require an appropriate definition of sustainability and sustainable development for the studied organisation. A common problem is inadequate understanding of what sustainability is from an organisational perspective. The purpose of this paper is to propose how to understand, define and measure diagnosing of sustainability from an outside-in perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The building, health care, education and tourism value chains are studied. Based on interpreted stakeholder sustainability needs the stages of understanding, defining and measuring of diagnosing are reviewed, and interpretations proposed. This is with focus on identifying the vital few sustainability impacts in the studied value chains. Findings: The resulting definitions and proposed performance indicators for the chosen areas indicate that the approach works resulting in proposed definitions and indicators for sustainability and sustainable development based on stakeholders need focus. Having clear definitions and performance indicators will support working effectively with sustainable development. Research limitations/implications: The resulting definitions and proposed performance indicators for the chosen areas indicate that the approach works. Further, proposed definitions and indicators for sustainability and sustainable development based on stakeholder needs focus is useful. Having clear definitions and performance indicators will help an organisation engage with sustainability and be sustainable within an organisational context. Practical implications: The proposed approach enables using quality management for sustainable development. Social implications: Social sustainability is viewed from a poverty and affordability perspective. Originality/value: Results indicate that there is a value in using an outside-in approach with focus on stakeholder needs in connection with a process-based approach. The approach is in contrast with the customary way of defining sustainability which mostly is based on an inside-out approach identifying several indicators and then adding these to a measure of sustainability. © 2022, Raine Isaksson, Swaminathan Ramanathan and Max Rosvall.","Diagnosing; Improvement potential; Opportunity study; Performance; Sustainability; Sustainable development","Benchmarking; Economic and social effects; Planning; Design/methodology/approach; Diagnosing; Improvement potential; Key Issues; Opportunity study; Organizational perspectives; Performance; Performance indicators; Sense making; Value chains; Sustainable development",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139173040

However, most logistics platforms do not possess operational sustainability due to excessive profit-seeking. To address this problem, conflicts of interest among freight transportation participants are discussed using a stakeholder approach. A three-player evolutionary game model (TEGM) is developed to analyze the interactions among freight carriers, freight shippers, and logistics platforms. Then, the asymptotic equilibrium and evolutionary stability strategies of the three-player game are analyzed. The results indicate that a high-level positive network externality is the driving force behind the logistics platform’s “high-level service”. A fairness payment incentive guarantees a “sharing” strategy for freight carriers and shippers. When the high-level positive network externality is limited and lower than a threshold value, there is no stable equilibrium point in the TEGM. A government tax incentive cannot change the freight carriers’ and shippers’ strategy to participate in this horizontal collaboration system, except for the logistics platform’s probability of providing “high-level service”. However, the behavioral strategies of the freight transportation participants can be changed to achieve the sustainability of freight transportation by reducing the value-added tax rate through the logistics platform and increasing the high-level positive network externality of the logistics platform and other participants’ perceived fairness through a payment incentive. Finally, suggestions for regulating the behaviors of freight transportation participants and promoting the sustainability of freight transportation are discussed. © 2022, The Author(s).","Evolutionary game; Freight transportation; Horizontal collaboration; Logistics platform; Vehicle capacity utilization",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139172704

Content analysis and coding determined attributes of policies across 4 FSG Tool domains, (1) nutrition standards referenced; (2) behavioral design strategies encouraging selection of healthier offerings; (3) facility efficiency and environmental sustainability; and (4) FSG implementation supports. Results: From 2015-2019, 5 FSG policies met study inclusion criteria. Four out of 5 policies earned a perfect nutrition score (100%) by referencing nutrition standards that align with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) and are operationalized for use in food service venues. Four out of 5 policies included at least 1 implementation supports provision, such as naming an implementing agency, and 2 included provisions that encourage local food sourcing. Conclusion: From 2015-2019, overall FSG policy comprehensiveness scores ranged from 24% to 73%, with most policies referencing food and nutrition standards that align to national nutrition recommendations. Public health practitioners can educate decision makers on the potential impact of FSG policies on diet-related health outcomes and associated cost savings, as well as other important co-benefits that support locally grown products and environmental sustainability practices. © The Author(s) 2022.","food service; food systems; health disparities; health policy; nutrition; sustainability","adoption; American; article; catering service; clinical article; content analysis; cost control; District of Columbia; environmental sustainability; female; government; health care policy; health disparity; human; legal database; male; nutrition; persuasive design; physician; practice guideline; public health; quantitative analysis; United States",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139168400

Growing demand and the dependence on poorly diversified oversea sources points towards a high strategic importance of domestic resources. Furthermore, potentially lower CO2 emissions and reduced areal use during lithium production are additional aspects that need to be considered. Based on the technology comparison for direct lithium extraction from geothermal fluids and the current state of geothermal energy production in Germany and the French part of the Upper Rhine Graben, different scenarios for the extractable amount of lithium carbonate were considered. In the most optimistic scenario, taking into account all currently active wells, a maximum production of 7200 t/a of lithium carbonate equivalent is expected. This could cover 5–19% of the annual demand of the planned German battery cell production. Key parameters for the process design are the usable volume fraction of the geothermal fluid and the extraction efficiency. Uncertainties in the resource assessment regarding its size, and the sustainability of its management, are still considerable. To exploit the great potential of this technology, these key issues need to be addressed. © 2022, The Author(s).","Geothermal fluids; Lithium market; Potential in Germany; Potential study; Production scenarios; Ressource assessment",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139167087

Methods: The center has utilized a rehabilitation pathway for pediatric heart transplant recipients. Challenges in practice include access to centers, lack of data tracing, and adherence to the pathway. The quality initiative focused on program refinements: implementation of text templates to improve data collection, collection of the Pediatric Cardiac Quality of Life Inventory (PCQLI), Functional Independence Measure (WeeFIM) and Child Occupational Self-Assessment (COSA), development of an outreach program, and creation of an educational program for therapists to increase content knowledge and improve clinician satisfaction. Results: In the evaluation of rehabilitation follow-up post-transplant, there was no statistical significance between the pre- and post-implementation groups. After the implementation of the refined pathway, there was an increase in the completion of the six-minute walk test post-transplant (p = 0.048). Clinicians’ responses post educational session noted familiarity with the pathway (88%), documentation (78.8%), and outcome measures (97%). Results of outcomes noted improvement in six-minute walk distances and a decrease in the rate of perceived exertion post-transplant.

Computer-aided tools such as building information modeling (BIM) are found in the forefront of this evolution, playing a critical role in creating the foundations for the upcoming development of smart low-carbon cities. However, the potential of BIM is still untapped – links will need to be created among the available and forthcoming methodologies under one integral operational system. The purpose of this paper is to present an integrated BIM-based life cycle-oriented framework for achieving sustainable constructions at the pre-construction phase. The developed framework represents an example of the approaches that the construction industry will need to adopt to integrate the different tools under an integrated smart city context. Design/methodology/approach: The methodological approach follows the development of four same-volume different-configuration three-dimensional BIM designs, which are coupled with life cycle assessment (LCA) tools for establishing sustainable building design. Findings: The results of this paper indicated that the choice of building design and shape can play a significant role in reducing the embodied energy and embodied carbon of buildings, achieving a reduction of up to 15% compared to a reference building of same volume and gross floor area.

Herein, the cycle equilibrium of water and fluoride in this process was investigated, and the pattern of enrichment of heavy metal ions (Cd, Cr, Cu, Zn, and As) was determined. The heavy metal ion content in raffinate does not increase with an increase in the number of raffinate cycles, thereby preventing any adverse effect on the purity of subsequent V products and ensuring the sustainability of the process. The neutralization slag with fixed heavy metal ions was subjected to solid waste leaching toxicity tests and was determined to be nonhazardous solid waste and showing potential for reuse. The raffinate contained 92% fluoride and was cycled to the next acid-leaching process, thus, achieving the purpose of fluoride reuse. Therefore, since 100% of the raffinate will be reused in the next leaching step, the raffinate cycle–leaching process has a positive prospect of being employed in the V industry.

The procedure is composed of the following components: (1) development of a continuous-time state dynamic model, (2) formulation of an interconnected hybrid dynamic model composed of both continuous and discrete-time states of time-to-event processes, (3) derivation of conceptual computational interconnected dynamic algorithm for time-to-event data statistic, and (4) construction of conceptual and computational simulation dynamic procedure for state and parameter estimations. The development of the presented approach is motivated by parameter and state estimation of time-to-event processes in biological, chemical, engineering, epidemiological, medical, military, and social dynamic processes under the influence of discrete-time intervention processes. The presented algorithm is independent of any particular form of survival distributions or data sets. Moreover, it does not require a closed form survival function distributions. The introduction of intervention processes provides a measure of influence of new tools/procedures/approaches in continuous-time states of time-to-event dynamic process. In particular, it generates a measure of the degree of sustainability, survivability, reliability of a time-to-event process. In addition, intervention processes provide comparison between the past and currently used tools/procedures/approaches/etc. The developed procedure coupled with modified Local Lagged Adapted Generalized Method of Moments (LLGMM) approach also provides a measure of degree of confidence, prediction, and planning assessments. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Conceptual computational parameter and state estimation schemes; interconnected discrete-time dynamic algorithm; modified LLGMM; stochastic hybrid dynamic process",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139154380

Such activities in many African organisations include paper-based information storage and communication which are not ecofriendly and place a huge burden on forest resources. This study therefore focused on the implication of overusing paper in an African university. Fifty offices in the university were surveyed and 59 questionnaires administered. The questionnaires were transcribed and analysed using both textual qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results showed that 6888 reams of paper (costing about 8 million Naira) are consumed annually by the university, translating to about 413 trees, which are enough to occupy a standard-sized football pitch. It was also found that administrative staff members were generally Information Communication Technology (ICT) certified; however, many of them are still not well-informed on the environmental implication of overconsuming paper even though they are largely aware of the benefits of paperless systems. Recommendations were offered on how to reduce the demand for paper by the university.

This study draws strength from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs-7, 11, 12, and 13). Therefore, this study examines the environmental nexus between economic growth, globalization, renewable, and non-renewable energy, in South America from 1995 to 2020. We deployed the pooled mean group (PMG), mean group (MG), and dynamic fixed effects (DFE). Cross-sectional dependence, panel unit root, and cointegration tests were performed. Finally, we used the Dumitrescu and Hurlin test of causality to determine the long-run association between variables. The finding indicates that while environmental pollution increases with increasing economic growth, it decreases with increasing renewable energy both in the short and long term. Whereas economic globalization positively affects environmental pollution in the long term, social globalization and the moderation effect between political globalization and renewable energy improves environmental quality in the long run. Finally, a bidirectional causality was found between economic growth and environmental pollution, with a unidirectional causality running from economic, political, and social globalization, renewable, and non-renewable energy to environmental pollution. Given these findings, we discussed potential policy measures. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Economic growth; Environmental pollution; Renewable energy; Renewable energy; South America",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139143871

Accordingly, developments of cost-effective and sustainable nanomaterials for water remediation are on top priority and highly sought in global research community. Carbon nano-onions (CNOs) are one of the emerging nanomaterials for water purification because of its unique morphology, surface reactivity, high density of surface-active sites, and microporous structure. Herein, flaxseed oil–derived CNOs are utilized as efficient adsorbent for the removal of toxic oxo-anions. Aside from the green and economic nature, CNOs provide high adsorption efficiency ~ 806.45 mg g−1 for the removal of MnO4- (99.9%) from aqueous system at ambient temperature, neutral pH in 70 min. The adsorption of MnO4- onto CNOs was well fitted in pseudo-second order kinetics and followed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. The adsorption process was determined to be exothermic and spontaneous from the resulting thermodynamic characteristics. Furthermore, the high hydrophobic nature of CNOs make it recycling simpler. The real-life applicability of CNOs towards MnO4- removal was tested in tap water, river water, and dam water. With all these observed results, CNOs show promise for practical water remediation applications.

The data was collected from multiple sources and thematic analysis was used to identify themes. The study produced three key findings. First, the study could extract two themes of benevolent leadership—striving for the common good and concern for others. Second, it could extend the understanding of social entrepreneurship by identifying two themes—social value creation and developing innovative business models. Third, it proposed a process framework by capturing the journey of SOS promoters towards the benevolent social entrepreneur over two decades.

However, the specific meaning of both concepts across different cultures has not been fully researched, and the terms are frequently assumed to have identical meanings to audiences from different cultures. We aim to close this research gap by studying how tourists from four different countries define and conceptualise “sustainability” and “sustainable tourism.” Specifically, we asked participants from Germany, Italy, Norway, and the United States to define “sustainability” and “sustainable tourism” using open ended questions in a qualitative study. We study the responses using an interdisciplinary framework which is based on research from tourism, intercultural studies, linguistics, and cognitive psychology. The findings show significant cross-cultural differences in respondents’ interpretations of sustainability and sustainable tourism, regarding both the content and the linguistic form of the definitions. Our research challenges the silent assumption that consumers worldwide share a common understanding of sustainability in tourism. We conclude that strategies for promoting sustainability and sustainable tourism must use strong verbal and visual cues tailored to the culture and language of diverse target groups.

Contaminated water treatment techniques are developed with various efficiencies. This differences in efficiencies are mainly related to operating and constructive issues. In this paper, pore flow approach was used to assess the efficiency of NF membrane (AFC 80) in removing chromium ion from aqueous solution. Moreover, it is also benefit to address the sustainability aspect of NF separation process. In this regard, DSPM-DE model combined with concentration polarization model (CP) was applied to predict Cr(VI) retention and specific energy consumption (SEC) at different operating conditions. This model allowed to characterize (AFC 80) membrane in terms of charge density, which differs from – 20 to -120 mmol/m3, and pore dielectric constant of 50. It is observed that concentration polarization effect can be avoided by using feed velocity higher than 0.4 m/s, which results in chromium retention value higher than 95%. The simulated retention values are fitted very well with the previous experimental results, which confirms the reliability of this modeling approach. At higher feed flow, SEC increased by factor of 15–19 times higher than that at lower feed flow of 0.1e-4 m3/s. Then, operation at moderate feed flow and pressure is recommended to achieve targets of high productivity and lower energy consumption. Ultimately, the proposed model can be used to predict performance of NF process at membrane scale as well as at module scale. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University.","Chromium; Membrane; Modeling; Process; Sustainable","Chemicals removal (water treatment); Chromium compounds; Metal ions; Nanofiltration; Polarization; Sustainable development; Water pollution; Chromium removal; Concentration polarization; Feed flows; Modeling; Pore-flow model; Process; Pure water; Specific energy consumption; Sustainable; Water availability; Energy utilization",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139137950

Amidst trade-offs between the processes of massification, democratization, commodification, and globalization, the question of transformation for sustainability has become crucial to the social good(s) of higher education. This paper considers academic citizenry within Indian public higher education — a context where the increase in the enrollment of first-generation students and female students, due to affirmative action policies, has not substantially translated into altering the composition of academic staff. Informed by a mixed-method study conducted in 2019 with the participation of academics and those in leadership positions at four higher education institutions, we found that the enactment of such policies was operationalized for the production of the “New Middle Class” by universities. Of concern is that neither the representation nor the participation of academics who are women, “lower” castes, or minorities meets the mark of just, inclusive institutions. Despite the rhetoric of inclusiveness and development, the implementation of related policies clothe subalterns with the veneer of the intellectual class, permitting access on condition that sociocultural identities are concealed, and the hegemonic status quo maintained.

Longevity societies imply financial sustainability challenges to guarantee adequate socioeconomic conditions for all individuals for a longer period. Consequently, modelling population dynamics and projecting future longevity scenarios are vital tasks for policymakers. As an answer, the demographic and the actuarial literature have been introduced and compared to several stochastic mortality models, although few studies have thoroughly tested the uncertainty concerning mortality projections. Forecasting mortality uncertainty levels have a central role since they reveal the potential, unexpected longevity rise and the related economic impact. Therefore, the present study poses a methodological framework to backtest uncertainty in mortality projections by exploiting uncertainty metrics not yet adopted in mortality literature. Using the data from the Human Mortality Database of the male and female populations of five countries, we present some numerical applications to illustrate how the proposed criterion works. The results show that there is no mortality model overperforming the others in all cases, and the best model choice depends on the data considered. © 2022, The Author(s).","Backtesting metrics; Models comparison; Prediction interval forecasting; Stochastic mortality models",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139134809

Design/methodology/approach: Applying case study methodology and drawing on Suchman’s theory on societal legitimacy, it is argued that social audits are artefacts of legitimacy, and global firms dominate the buyer–supplier relationship across the supply chain. The analysis is based on data collected from different secondary sources, including Walmart’s corporate sustainability reports. Findings: Using Walmart’s relationship with Tazreen Fashions Limited around the Tazreen factory fire incident as a case study, it explains that the practices which attempt to symbolically demonstrate accountability from social audits need to shift to a more continuous and sincere demonstration of accountability through the social audit process. For this to occur, the cognitive and pragmatic approaches that international buyers have previously used in auditing their supply firms’ social responsibility are no longer sufficient to achieve societal legitimacy. Instead, a moral turn needs to underpin the intentions and actions of these buyers to maintain legitimacy and demonstrate accountability across the supply industry in developing economies. Originality/value: The findings of the study answer the questions raised in the extant literature about the expectation from social auditing and whether social auditing serves to ensure corporate accountability. The paper contributes to the policymaking discussion of how social auditing can be configured to include a legal provision to ensure that social auditing is not a parroting tool for corporations. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bangladesh; Legitimacy; Ready-made garment industry; Social auditing; Tazreen; Walmart",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139134426

Currently, South Africa’s marine governance sector is often fraught with politicking, inefficiencies, and other effects that strain the social-ecological system. This research shows that despite some fragmentation of governance, there are opportunities, and a general willingness, to engage in activities that take care of the local environment on the behalf of residents, that serve to educate about ocean-positive behaviours and engage visitors more meaningfully on the benefits and value of the Stilbaai Marine Protected Area. Problems that residents perceive to be associated with the Marine Protected Area are noted, and suggestions are made to enhance a sense of caretaking, or sorgskap, within the community to fill the gaps of certain governance or regulation inadequacies. Indeed, I argue that in lieu of efficient formal governance structures and collaborations, it is the informal characteristic of caretaking activities by the community that renders these activities more sustainable, long term, and effective in building a “culture” of caretaking. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Care; Coastal sustainability; Marine governance; Marine Protected Areas; Relationality; Stewardship",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139132820

Little is known about the facilitators and barriers of implementing and sustaining EBPs in Native communities. This paper aims to identify those factors described by educators who implemented the Native Students Together Against Negative Decisions (STAND) curriculum. Methods. We conducted qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 44 Native STAND educators from 48 sites throughout the United States. We used a modified grounded theory approach to explore barriers, facilitators, and sustainability factors related to implementing Native STAND. Results. We learned that disruptions to staffing, coordination, and organizational factors were the most common barriers. Factors that improved implementation success included: tailoring the program to local needs/constraints, having a supportive Project Manager, improved fidelity due to check-in calls, and participation in summer training. Factors that improved sustainability included: access to needed infrastructure, administrative support, community support, and student interest. Discussion. The delivery of Native STAND was further improved by person-to-person communication and resource sharing across sites. Sustaining EBPs in AI/AN settings requires culturally-tailored technical assistance, sufficient implementation funds for materials and staffing, and a community of peer educators to inspire forward progress. Conclusion. EBPs that reflect the needs and experiences of American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth are necessary to address systemic inequities in adolescent health outcomes. The Native STAND Dissemination and Implementation study is among the first to assess facilitators and barriers to program delivery in diverse AI/AN settings. © 2022 Society for Public Health Education.","American Indian or Native American; evaluation; general terms; implementation science; place; population groups; qualitative methods; school-based health promotion","adolescent; adolescent health; American Indian; article; clinical article; community support; curriculum; evidence based practice center; female; grounded theory; health promotion; human; human experiment; implementation science; juvenile; male; manager; multicenter study; population group; qualitative analysis; semi structured interview; summer; United States",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139127554

With its growth, the demand for alternative, cheaper and high-quality feed ingredients is also increasing. Innovation investments on providing new functional feed alternatives have yielded several viable alternative raw materials. Considering all the current feed ingredients, their circular adaption in the aquafeed manufacturing industry is clearly of the utmost importance to achieve sustainable aquaculture in the near future. The use of terrestrial plant materials and animal by-products predominantly used in aquafeed ingredients puts a heavily reliance on terrestrial agroecosystems, which also has its own sustainability concerns. Therefore, the aquafeed industry needs to progress with functional and sustainable alternative raw materials for feed that must be more resilient and consistent, considering a circular perspective. In this review, we assess the current trends in using various marine organisms, ranging from microorganisms (including fungi, thraustochytrids, microalgae and bacteria) to macroalgae and macroinvertebrates as viable biological feed resources. This review focuses on the trend of circular use of resources and the development of new value chains. In this, we present a perspective of promoting novel circular economy value chains that promote the re-use of biological resources as valuable feed ingredients. Thus, we highlight some potentially important marine-derived resources that deserve further investigations for improving or addressing circular aquaculture. © 2022 The Authors.

In most risk management processes, risk identification forms a long list or matrix, which it difficult in identifying more influenced risks. Preparing a risk list or risk matrix in the identification process has become inadequate for prioritizing risks. The construction industry is classified as commercial, industrial, and residential; identifying and managing the project risk for them on a common platform is difficult. In the present work risk breakdown structure (RBS) tool is used for the brief, clear identification of risks by interviewing and brainstorming with the experts involved in three commercial construction projects. It provides a means for grouping all possible individual project risks into risk categories (RC), linked by father/son relations, and risk events (RE) form the hierarchy. Further, analyzed to find the impact on the three main pillars of sustainability: Environmental, Financial, and Social. The plotted results are further structured with the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and found the global weight of each RC’s.

As the living environments of soil bacteria, soil aggregates significantly affect the diversity and composition regarding soil bacterial communities in CFPs. However, the distribution characteristics exhibited by soil bacteria at the aggregate scale are still not clear. In the present research, the diversity and composition regarding soil bacterial communities (using high-flux sequencing) in CFPs with diverse stand ages (3, 9, 17, and 26 years) were analyzed from the perspective of soil aggregates (>2, 1–2, 0.25–1, <0.25 mm) in Guangxi, China. According to the results, regardless of the aggregate size and the stand age, bacterial communities in soil were mainly composed of Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Acidobacteria. During Chinese fir growth, the relative abundance (RA) of soil Proteobacteria first elevated and afterwards reduced, with the greatest level in the 17 years, while that of soil Chloroflexi exhibited an inverse trend. In addition, the RA of soil Acidobacteria increased over time. At the aggregate scale, the 17-year-old CFPs presented the greatest soil bacterial community diversity (based on the Chao 1 and Shannon indices). After 17 years, the destruction of coarse macroaggregates (>2 mm) could induce the reduction of soil bacterial community diversity, as coarse macroaggregates, taking up the majority of bulk soil, offered suitable environments for soil bacteria to survive and thrive. Moreover, soil organic C and total N concentrations and soil pH also significantly affected the diversity and composition regarding soil bacterial communities over time. Hence, the conservation of coarse macroaggregates after 17 years of Chinese fir growth is important to sustain the soil health as well as the bacterial community diversity in Guangxi, China. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","bacterial community composition; bacterial community diversity; Chinese fir plantations; soil aggregates; stand ages","Aggregates; Bacteria; Soil conservation; Bacterial community; Bacterial community composition; Bacterial community diversity; Chinese fir; Chinese fir plantation; Community diversity; Soil aggregate; Soil bacterial community; Soil bacterium; Stand age; Soils",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139120142

Lock-in was studied in various sectors, considering production or consumption sides. Lock-in in academic research went little addressed. Yet, science develops through knowledge accumulation and cross-fertilisation of research topics, that could lead to similar phenomena when some topics do not sufficiently benefit from accumulation mechanisms, reducing innovation opportunities from the concerned field consequently. We introduce an original method to explore these phenomena by comparing topic trajectories in research fields according to strong or weak accumulative processes over time. We combine the concepts of ‘niche’ and ‘mainstream’ from transition studies with scientometric tools to revisit Callon’s strategic diagram with a diachronic perspective of topic clusters over time. Considering the trajectories of semantic clusters, derived from titles and authors’ keywords extracted from scholarly publications in the Web of Science, we applied our method to two competing research fields in food sciences and technology related to pulses and soya over the last 60 years worldwide. These highly interesting species for the sustainability of agrifood systems experienced unbalanced development and thus is under-debated. Our analysis confirms that food research for soya was more dynamic than for pulses: soya topic clusters revealed a stronger accumulative research path by cumulating mainstream positions while pulses research did not meet the same success. This attempt to unpack research lock-in for evaluating the competition dynamics of scientific fields over time calls for future works, by strengthening the method and testing it on other research fields.

Concurrently, food also has a critical role in addressing the complex challenges cities are facing. Food pedagogies has emerged as a key element in tackling these food-related issues. However, pedagogical aspects of food are yet to be broadly explored and no known conceptual pedagogical framework has been developed. This paper aims to inform development of a conceptual framework for the enactment of food pedagogies, based on community food leaders’ perspectives and experiences. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 39 experienced leaders from diverse food-related fields in Australia. Interviews were analyzed thematically. Four key themes emerged from participants’ reflections on the current state of food-related activities: ‘Awareness of food and food systems’; ‘Enjoyment and social connections’; ‘Experiential practices in everyday life’: and ‘Action for change.’ These four themes are discussed both as aims of pedagogical practices and as essential pedagogical content for conceptualizing food pedagogies. A draft conceptual framework is developed to inform actions by policy makers, and public and private sector food practitioners to create healthy and sustainable societies through the medium of food. © 2022 Association for the Study of Food and Society (ASFS).","food education; Food pedagogies; food practitioners; food-related activities; societal health; sustainability; urban food strategies",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139107880

Water availability is the environmental factor that most limits the sustainability of agricultural systems. The adoption of sustainable technologies that improve plant water use efficiency has become increasingly important in modern agriculture. Humic acids (HA) acts as a rhizospheric bioeffector, stimulating the biochemical and physiological activities of plants. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of humic acids from vermicompost (HAVC), previously characterized by ATR-FTIR and 1 H-NMR, in stimulating the emission kinetics of the transient fluorescence of chlorophyll a, the concentrations of photosynthetic pigments and soluble metabolites, development of the root system and accumulation of fresh and dry biomass in rice (Oryza sativa L.) under normal growth conditions and water deficit. The experimental design was completely randomized, with four treatments (Control; HAVC; PEG-6000; HAVC + PEG-6000). The application of HAVC in plants under water deficit was efficient in maintaining photosynthesis, with an effect as an eustressor. HAVC triggered the increase of plant biomass and root development of plants under water deficit. HAVC acted on osmotic regulation and the influx and remobilization of different forms of nitrogen, enhancing protection against stress. HAVC in the rhizosphere induced plants with higher root biomass, partially due to better photosynthetic performance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Brazilian Society of Plant Physiology.","Eustress; Humic substances; Photosynthesis; Spectroscopy; Water deficiency",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139104899

This study examined the feasibility and cost-benefits of a personalized home automation intervention for care of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) with emphasis on their safety and independence, and reduction of care burden. Methods: A mixed method intervention study was conducted with five dyads each comprising of a caregiver and care recipient with ADRD. Each dyad received personalized home automation intervention with individualized goals centred on home safety, activity engagement, and caregiver-recipient connectivity. The goals were created and monitored using goal attainment scaling (GAS). The dyads were followed up after three months with a home visit and interview. Goal attainment scoring and thematic analysis of the interviews were conducted to examine the findings from the study. Results: All dyads indicated positive goal attainment between pre and post intervention. Goals that were met were complimented by the categories of peace of mind, self-efficacy, and care recipient engagement, while unmet goals as well as complexities with the technology were elucidated under challenges. Overarching and conceptually linked themes from the study were unfamiliarity, value, and timing. Conclusion: Home automation technology has the potential to be adapted to promote independence and safety of individuals with ADRD while relieving care burden. Nonetheless, we propose an early intervention framework to overcome identified challenges and optimize the technology’s usability and sustainability.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Home automation involving Internet of Things and Smart gadgets has gained rapid popularity owing to the comfort and connectivity they provide to mainstream consumers. The technology has an emerging significance to ageing-in-place and care of individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD) as it can be adapted and implemented to enhance home safety and activity engagement of the care recipients while also strengthening their connectivity with the caregivers. Unfamiliarity with the technology compounded by the progression of ADRD can, however, be detrimental to its adoption. Individualized focus and early integration of the technology for caregiver-care recipient dyads can mitigate these challenges and optimize its usability and long-term value in relation to ageing-in-place and caregiver wellbeing. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ageing in place; Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia; caregiving; goal attainment scaling; Home automation; smart home technology; usability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139104762

Microbes-based enzymes such as esterases, cutinases, and lipases have shown the ability to degrade synthetic plastic. However, the degradation of plastics by enzymes is primarily limited by the unavailability of a robust enzymatic system, i.e., low activity and stability towards plastic degradation. Recently, the machine learning strategy involved structure-based and deep neural networks show desirable potential to generate functional, active stable, and tolerant polyethylene terephthalate (PET) degrading enzyme (FAST-PETase). FAST-PETase showed the highest PET hydrolytic activity among known enzymes or their variants and degraded broad ranges of plastics. The development of a closed-loop circular economy-based system of plastic degradation to monomers by FAST-PETase followed by the re-polymerization of monomers into clean plastics can be a more sustainable approach. As an alternative to synthetic plastics, diverse microbes can produce polyhydroxyalkanoates, and their degradation by microbes has been well-established.

Integrating the SC with Industry 4.0 key enabling technologies creates visibility and sustainability in SCs. It also fosters intelligent decision-making, thereby making a SC smart. However, how Industry 4.0 technologies affect key performance indicators (KPIs) of a resilient SC and may help achieve sustainability is rarely studied. Design/methodology/approach: Sixteen KPIs were identified from the literature review and analyzed using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) using expert opinions. Further, a sensitivity analysis was conducted for the KPIs by varying the weightage of the criteria. Later, KPIs results were analyzed, and (1) how and which Industry 4.0 technology helps improve the KPI? (2) Resilience relationship with sustainability? were discussed. Findings: The analyses show that the time-oriented (TO) is an essential criterion and organizational (OR) is the less important comparatively. Lead time, time to market and risk assessment frequency are the top KPIs that need a focus. Blockchain, Big Data and Cyber-physical systems enhance KPI's value and, in turn, foster economic, environmental and social sustainability of the SC and help in better decision making in terms of smart contracts, better forecasting and enhanced real-time information sharing. Originality/value: Identification of the KPIs, the impact of Industry 4.0 technologies and the impact on sustainability; this kind of interplay is rarely evident in the literature. Understanding the findings of this research will help managers develop smart systems that may work intelligently to overcome risks associated and enhance sustainability.

Its legitimacy and sustainability are put to the test with the growth of deglobalization forces, the rise of emerging powers dissatisfied with the LIO designed by the US, and climate change and the global pandemic. The crisis of the LIO is particularly salient in the Indo-Pacific, the epicenter of the US-China strategic competition, and secondary states in this region are increasingly concerned about its geopolitical consequences. However, I argue that secondary states often treated as the pawns of great powers can turn this circumstance to their advantage by adopting various strategies that maximize their leverage. We should take seriously the possibility that secondary states, by which I denote all states that are weaker or smaller than the hegemonic state and the rising power, can shape the contours of the US-China strategic competition and the newly emerging international order in the Indo-Pacific region. Preoccupied with great power politics, the existing literature on order transition has neglected the fact that secondary states can develop and exercise their own agency. Moreover, it remains vague what agency means in IR and how secondary states enact it. Against this backdrop, I propose an analytical framework that unpacks various types of agency along three dimensions—the motivation of agency, the type of mobilized resources, and the availability of partners. It will help us explain how weaker and smaller states participate and make their voice in reshaping international order in the Indo-Pacific. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Agency; Indo-Pacific; order transition; secondary states",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139098150

Central to such an approach is coherent action across sectors and scales. Although inter-and transdisciplinary approaches are widely discussed, no convergence model exists to detect and prepare for food system vulnerabilities emerging from disruptions in climate systems, or to address the contributions to climate change from food system functions. Convergence research is critical to solving these vexing dynamics by integrating knowledge from multiple scientific domains to inform societal action. Here, we present a new convergent science model that incorporates four key components at the global, national and local level. Through the newly created Food and Climate Systems Transformation Alliance, we are now operationalizing, testing and refining the model to promote science convergence for tackling systemic vulnerabilities in the current food paradigm.

Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of secondary cities is critical for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 11. This paper examines the emerging spatial and temporal evolution of two secondary cities in Northern Ghana. The paper utilizes raster data (1990–2019) and applied landscape metrics to analyze spatial development in Wa and Bolgatanga municipalities along three concentric rings. The results show significant increase in built areas over the study period. Urban development in the two cities is becoming more or less fragmented, dispersed and contiguous. Inadequate spatial planning, weakly regulated development and uncoordinated land markets account for the fragmentated spatial forms. The two cities exhibit a monocentric form that fluctuates, is dynamic, and discontinuous. The paper reflects on the implications of the findings and suggests the need for a planned extension of secondary cities in Africa to generate efficient urban forms, curtail sprawl and protect the natural environment. © 2022 Urban Affairs Association.","landscape metrics; spatial development; sustainability; urban planning; Urbanization",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139096492

These are: (1) network infrastructure, with the corresponding concerns of control, surveillance, and data privacy and ownership; (2) post-political governance, embodied in the tensions between public and private decision-making and cities as post-political entities; (3) social inclusion, expressed in the aspects of citizen participation and inclusion, and inequality and discrimination; and (4) sustainability, with a specific focus on the environment as an element to protect but also as a strategic element for the future. Given the persisting disagreements around the definition of a smart city, the article identifies in these four dimensions a more stable reference framework within which ethical concerns can be clustered and discussed. Identifying these dimensions makes possible a review of the ethical implications of smart cities that is transversal to their different types and resilient towards the unsettled debate over their definition. © 2022, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Data privacy; Ethics; Smart cities; Surveillance","Decision making; Ethical technology; Smart city; Sustainable development; 'current; Citizen's participations; Decisions makings; Ethical concerns; Ethical implications; Four dimensions; Network infrastructure; Reference frameworks; Social inclusion; Surveillance; Data privacy",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139091942

Less attention has been devoted to estimating the sustainability practices on an event basis. The current study was carried out to analyse the sustainability practices adopted by companies during the period of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). A sustainability performance measurement (SPM) framework was constructed using content analysis, to measure the performance of Sensex companies towards sustainability efforts. Sensex constitutes 30 well-established and financially sound companies listed in the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). The primary elements of the SPM framework were derived from Sustainable Development Goals, which are considered to be a blueprint for a sustainable future. The initiatives taken by companies during the period of ‘covidization’ were classified under different parameters of SPM and then quantified with the help of mathematical tools. The results signify that there lies a scope of 63.08% improvement in sustainability practices of overall industries. Further, there is a huge gap of 76.92% between the best-performing and least-performing companies. The performance of all the sectors studied for the sustainability practices was statistically at par with each other. However, the difference between the best-performing (fast-moving consumer goods—FMCG) and least performing (finance) sectors was found to be 42.74%. The result of analysis of variance (ANOVA) for performance across various sustainability parameters taken up by different sectors was significantly different from each other. A gap of 86.67% was uncovered in our analysis between the best-performing and least-performing sustainability parameters taken up by the companies under various sectors. Considering the fact that COVID-19 is a medical emergency, the performance of ‘good health and well-being’ as the best-performing sustainability parameter is justified. But at the same time, importance of other sustainability parameters cannot be ignored. It has also been observed that even in times of dire necessity, the prevailing undersized image of sustainability efforts of selected sample companies was not satisfactory. It is suggested that the corporate sector and the government should be more cautious in pursuing the objective of sustainability. © 2022 International Management Institute, New Delhi.","Content analysis; corporate sector; corporate sustainability; COVID-19; sustainability performance measurement; sustainability practices; sustainable development goals (SDGs)",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139090075

This requires that sustainability is endorsed by a group or opinion leader to be adopted by society. Organisations have been instrumental in fostering sustainability and can be such opinion leaders. During the last 10 years, there has been an increasing interest in organisational sustainability; however, research on civil society organisations (CSOs) has been scarce. Sports organisations (such as football clubs) are a particular type of CSO, and have been adopting sustainability, albeit slowly. Twelve interviews with representatives of Swedish football clubs (from which nine were male clubs and three were female clubs) were conducted between August and November 2021. The data were analysed using Grounded Theory's constant comparative analysis method. The findings show that football clubs have been undertaking several sustainability efforts (e.g. stakeholder collaboration, energy, health, gender and transportation) and have been connecting the sustainability dimensions throughout such efforts. The findings provide insights into the stages of sustainability awareness in football clubs, starting from the social dimension, then the environmental, economic and time dimensions. An important finding from the interviews was the potential that football clubs have in engaging and influencing society through their fans. This research provides insights into the contributions of football clubs to sustainability.

However, previous studies on the performance impacts of total quality management practices have mainly focused on the financial performance of firms in the manufacturing sector. This study focusses on the research questions: (1) What is the effect of TQM practices on operational performance? and (2) How do TQM practices combine to influence the operational performance of healthcare facilities? Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 154 health facilities (i.e. private hospitals, pharmacies, maternity clinics, and diagnostic centres), the authors applied symmetric (PLS-SEM) and asymmetric (fsQCA) data analysis approaches to examine how TQM practices influence the operational performance of health facilities in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Findings: The PLS-SEM results revealed that five out of the seven TQM practices investigated influenced operational performance. However, the fsQCA results identify five different complex combinations of TQM practices that lead to operational performance. Research limitations/implications: Longitudinal studies can be conducted in the future to assess changes in the variables over time. A control variable, such as firm size, should be considered to assess the level of implementation of TQM practices based on firm size. A different performance measure, for instance, sustainability indicators or the balance score card, could be used to examine performance. Practical implications: A proper and coordinated integration of the TQM practices is required for firms to be able to achieve operational performance. TQM practices vary in their sufficiency for operational outcomes; therefore, management needs to carefully consider their implementation as part of the organisation's strategy. Originality/value: This research, by focussing on TQM practices from both symmetrical and asymmetrical perspectives, contributes to the understanding of the literature on TQM, thereby providing actionable insight on how to invest in the various TQM practices for improved operational performance. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer focus; fsQCA; Knowledge management; Management leadership; Operational performance; PLS-SEM; Process management; Strategic quality planning; Supplier quality management; Total quality management; Training","Customer satisfaction; Manufacture; Total quality management; Customer focus; FsQCA; Management leadership; Operational performance; PLS-SEM; Process management; Quality management practices; Quality planning; Strategic quality planning; Supplier quality management; Knowledge management",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139083282

Design/methodology/approach: This study adapts the concept of using an assessment model in a bespoke application of Sulitest® and Assessment of Student Knowledge. A total of 650 undergraduate students (in the environment, engineering and agriculture programs) were administered a paper-based questionnaire from June to July 2019. Findings: This study determined that Nigerian students performed poorly on the sustainability literacy test (SLT). Furthermore, students majoring in agriculture exhibited higher knowledge in the social and overall topics, followed by students majoring in the environmental field. From the study findings, the authors recommend that periodic assessment using SLT measures will help higher education institutions (HEIs) identify targeted sustainability programs for the development of students and educators. Hence, HEIs in Nigeria and elsewhere should use sustainability assessment tools to promote pro-environmental awareness. Originality/value: The SLT is one of several options to assess sustainability knowledge in HEIs. Several HEIs across the USA and Europe have been known to adopt some SLT assessment techniques to improve environmental literacy among students.

A global analysis of core city growth can help predict future development with respect to different natural and social settings. However, current studies largely focus on limited cities or time series of urban expansion, providing limited insight to assess the status of global sustainable development in urban areas. In this study, we examined the morphological evolution of 2276 cities worldwide from 2003 to 2018 using harmonized nighttime satellite data. We found that during the study period the global core city area increased nearly 52 % with Asia leading the growth (4.5 × 105 km2) and North America growing the least (0.8 × 105 km2). Based on the morphological characteristics, we further identified six city morphological types: decelerated, intensifying, stable, mature, growing, and shrinking. The decelerated type dominated, followed by the intensifying and shrinking types. Cities falling within the other three patterns accounted for about 10 % of the total. Cities with the stable and mature types grew slowly, mainly found in developed regions such as Europe and North America, while cities with the growing type exhibited a high growth rate and were mostly located in developing regions such as Africa and Asia. Moreover, cities with the shrinking pattern were also found in certain developed regions such as Japan, coinciding with the population decline there. Our analysis of global urban morphology 16 years can provide valuable insights into the variations of global core city growth, which are critical for formulating effective policies to achieve urban sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Core city growth; Natural city; Nighttime satellite data; Urban morphology; Urban shrinkage; Urbanization",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139075397

The lack of strategic management and top-level commitment have been found to be major hindrances to the promotion of sustainable public procurement (SPP). This study aims to examine the functioning of a successful Finnish SPP development programme, the KEINO Academy (2019–2020), that tackled these challenges in a holistic way. Design/methodology/approach: The article is mainly based on qualitative analysis of interviews with 24 municipal representatives. Findings: The KEINO Academy advanced SPP management through the following functions: legitimising SPP development work, structuring SPP development work, offering expert support and facilitating peer support. The functions were mainly able to meet the key challenges experienced by the participating municipalities. However, some challenges cannot be directly solved by an intermediary such as the KEINO Academy. These challenges include, for example, a lack of resources. Social implications: On the basis of the study, SPP development programmes should: build a holistic working model; respect the versatility of the participating organisations; involve all the key people in the organisations, including the directors; and sustain change.

This study explores the knowledge, attitudes and behavioural intentions of young Danish consumers towards carbon offsetting. Qualitative interviews with 25 young Danish consumers were conducted based on the theory of planned behaviour, which was used as a conceptual framework. The results of the study indicate that the young consumers have little knowledge of VCO and perceive the topic as complicated and difficult.

The antecedents and characteristics of early retirement schemes implemented by Australian universities between 2010 and 2020 were considered. Twenty-eight schemes were identified across 20 universities. Content analysis of descriptions of the schemes contained in official documents was undertaken. This revealed somewhat common justifications for the schemes, linked to concerns about organisational sustainability/resilience in the face of external threats and the implementation of modernising efforts. Such justifications appeared to be underpinned by similar ageist biases on the part of management. Despite this broad commonality, however, the schemes manifested a multifurcation of possible work-retirement pathways across institutions. Such reorganisation of labour processes, based on ageist representations that potentially place established workers in conflict with others, represents an incongruence between the market-oriented objectives of universities and areas of public policy responding to workforce ageing. It is argued that drawing momentum from emerging conceptions of sustainability and current diversity initiatives such as Athena Swan and Age Friendly Universities it may be possible to sever the link university leadership perceive between the divestment of older workers and the fulfilment of modernising agendas.

The pervasive effects of global warming have raised concerns about the sustainability of the present and future generations. Hence, researchers are working assiduously towards proffering the most effective method of halting the surging emissions from global, regional, and national angles. This study contributes to the extant literature by providing the first empirical verification of how renewable energy, technological innovations, trade openness, and transport services impact carbon emissions in Germany. The empirical evidence is anchored on annual time series data from 1990 to 2020 estimated using the novel nonlinear ARDL to explore the positive and negative shocks associated with the short and long-run nexus. The wavelet coherence estimator is equally for ascertaining the multiple time scales in the time series and extends the knowledge frontier to the literature. The following findings are eminent from the overall analyses. First, long-run cointegration is supported among the variables of interest Second, only the adverse effects of renewable energy and technology are substantial enough to mitigate carbon emissions. The trade-induced emissions are established with the positive impacts of trade openness on carbon emissions. Transport services contribute significantly to carbon emissions in the long-run and short-run periods.

The present paper focuses on regulatory barriers viewed from the perspective of construction industry experts in achieving sustainable buildings. Design/methodology/approach: The present study uses a qualitative research method and semi-structured interviews as a research instrument. The present study interviews around 20 experts in construction and property management, property development, spatial planning and energy management. Findings: The study finds that Kosovo building laws and regulations provide for the materials assessment criteria, but the materials assessment criteria are only for mechanic strength. The study further finds that the sustainability concept is not included and incorporated in Kosovo's urban planning laws and regulations. The study also finds that despite specific clauses mentioning energy performance certificates in the Law on Energy Performance of Buildings in Kosovo, energy performance certificates appears to be not enforced and the nature of the barrier is more organizational rather than regulatory. Finally, the study finds that Kosovo laws are silent as far as green labeling of building materials is concerned. Practical implications: The implication of the present finding is that policymakers in Kosovo not only should include clear sustainable materials assessment criteria in the law, but also enforce those criteria through testing and inspection mechanisms included in the law and implemented in practice through funding and organizational support. Nonetheless, policymakers in Kosovo should contemplate amending the urban planning laws in Kosovo and include both the term of sustainability at the planning level and conformity guidelines for sustainable design that can be done at the administrative directive level. Further, the clauses in the law do not suffice if the clauses are not accompanied by specific systemic and organizational support in the issuance of energy performance certificates. Policymakers in Kosovo should be proactive in designing clauses that specify green labeling standards for materials; however, these labeling standards should not adversely affect the cost of construction and reduce the demand for real estate. Originality/value: The study is the first qualitative study about the perception of construction professionals in Kosovo, regarding the regulatory barriers of sustainable buildings in Kosovo. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Energy certificates; Green labeling; Implementation; Kosovo; Regulatory barriers; Sustainable buildings",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139061164

By adopting both symmetric and asymmetric empirical approaches over the period 1990–2019, the study found that positive and negative shifts in environmental-related technologies mitigates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the region with the former causing a larger impact. Furthermore, the findings reveal that a positive shift in raw material productivity mitigates GHG emissions while a negative shift in raw material productivity causes a surge in GHG emissions especially in the long-run. Moreover, a positive (negative) shift in export intensity yields a decline (upsurge) in GHG emissions in the long-run. In the symmetric framework, in both long- and short-run, the result reveals that economic growth upsurges GHG emissions while raw material productivity for green growth and environmental-related technologies mitigates GHG emissions. This demonstrates the efficient raw material productivity profile of the Nordic countries. Alongside the Granger causality inference, the result further informs that energy intensity is crucial to curbing GHG emissions in the region.

As cancers get more prevalent with age, treatment costs are expected to keep rising with aging populations. The objective of the study is to analyze the changes in cost of cancer care broken down into separate cost components and outcomes of cancer treatment in the Nordic countries 2012–2017. Materials and methods: We estimated direct costs of cancer based on retrospective data from national registers: outpatient care and inpatient care in primary care and specialized care as well as medicine costs. The number of cancer cases and survival data was obtained from NORDCAN. Cancer was defined as ICD-10 codes C00–C97. Results: Healthcare costs of cancer in real terms increased in all countries: CAGR was between 1 and 6% depending on the country. Medicine costs have increased rapidly (37–125%) in all countries during the observation period. In Finland and Denmark, inpatient care costs have decreased, whereas in Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, they have increased, although the number of inpatient days has decreased everywhere. The age-standardized cancer mortality has decreased constantly over time. Conclusion: Cancer care in Nordic countries has significant differences in both cost structures and in the development of cost drivers, indicating differences in the organization of care and different focus in health policy. It is important to compare the cancer care costs internationally on a detailed level to understand the reasons for cost development. The registration of cost data, especially medicine costs, should be more standardized to enable better cost and outcomes comparisons between countries in the future. © 2022 Acta Oncologica Foundation.","benchmarking; Cancer; cost trends; costs; Nordic countries","adult; article; benchmarking; cancer mortality; cancer survival; cancer therapy; controlled study; Denmark; female; Finland; health care cost; health care policy; hospital patient; human; ICD-10; Iceland; male; Norway; outcome assessment; outpatient care; primary medical care; retrospective study; Sweden",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139057119

Finding new strategies to mitigate the impact on wellbeing and healthcare systems is critical. Food prescription programs (FPPs) have been promoted as one route to address this problem in a way that simultaneously addresses the socio-cultural context of obesity. Yet, little is known about the standard practices and logistics of using food prescription programs as an effective intervention. Objectives: To 1) identify the context in which food prescription programs are used; 2) identify implementation logistics of food prescription program; and 3) understand the scope of food prescription program outcomes. Methods: A scoping review was conducted from October 2019 to May 2020 using Google Scholar, EBSCOhost, and AcademicOne Search to identify research articles focused on the implementation of prescription food programs in the US. Updates to articles were made in May of 2021 and May of 2022 to ensure the most up-to-date sample for analysis. There was no publication date restriction for article inclusion. Results: A total of 213 articles were identified for abstract review via the search strategy, and 30 articles were included for analysis following article exclusion. Overall, there was little consistency among included articles regarding the target population, participant recruitment, delivery, and evaluation of the food prescription programs implemented. Most food prescription programs studied were associated with farmers markets, lasted less than 6 months, and utilized produce consumption and biometric data as primary outcomes measures. Conclusion: Significant gaps in the literature concerning the long-term effectiveness, impact on health behaviors, screening of eligible participants, and logistics for implementation were identified. Future research should focus on addressing these shortcomings in the current literature to improve the implementation, sustainability, and scaling of food prescription programs. © 2022","Chronic disease management; Community programming; Food prescription; produce prescription; Program implementation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139055468

Design: A qualitative research approach was adopted, including focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews. Methods: Four different groups of participants were interviewed, that is, patients (n = 17), TM teams (n = 27), GPs (n = 16), and primary care nurses (n = 12). An interview guide was drafted based on a literature review. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and NVivo was used for managing and analyzing the data. The QUAGOL method was used to guide the data analysis process and was adapted for the purpose of a thematic content analysis. Results: All participants agreed that RPM-reassured patients. The overall perceived value of RPM for individual patients depended on how well the intervention matched with their needs. Patients who did not have the necessary language (Dutch/French speaking) and digital skills, who did not have the right equipment (smartphone or tablet), or who missed the necessary infrastructure (no internet coverage in their region) were often excluded. Remote patient monitoring also reassured healthcare professionals as it gave them information on a disease they had little knowledge about. Professionals involved in RPM experienced a high workload. All TM teams agreed that quality of data was a key factor to ensure an adequate follow-up, but they differed in what they found important. The logistic management of RPM was a challenge because of the contagious character of COVID-19, and the need for an effective information flow between the hospital team and primary care providers. Participants missed clarification about who was accountable for the care for patients in the projects. Primary care nurses and GPs missed access to RPM data. All agreed that the funding they received was not sufficient to cover all the costs associated with RPM. Conclusion: Healthcare professionals and patients perceive RPM as valuable and believe that the concept will have its place in the Belgium health system. However, current RPM practice is challenged by many barriers, and the sustainability of RPM implementation is low. Clinical relevance: Remote patient monitoring (RPM) was perceived as a valuable intervention for patients with COVID-19, but there were important concerns about unequal access to care. While the technology for RPM is available, the sustainability of implementation is low because of concerns with data quality, challenging logistics within projects, lack of data integration and communication, and a lack of an overarching guiding framework. © 2022 Sigma Theta Tau International.","COVID-19; e-health; focus group; implementation; interview; remote patient monitoring; telemonitoring",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139051515

Numerous applications of ammonia as a fuel have been developed for energy generation, heavy transportation, and clean, distributed energy storage. There is a clear global target to achieve a sustainable economy and carbon neutrality. Therefore, most of the research's efforts are concentrated on generating cost-effective renewable energy on a large scale rather than fossil fuels. However, storage and transportation are still roadblocks for these technologies, for example, hydrogen technologies. Ammonia could be replaced as a viable fuel for a clean and sustainable future of global energy. More efforts from governments and scientists can lead to making ammonia a clean energy vector in most energy applications. In this review, ammonia synthesis was assessed, including conventional Haber–Bosch technology. Current hydrogen technologies as the key parameters for ammonia generation are also evaluated. The role of ammonia as a hydrogen-based fuel and generation roadmap are discussed for future utilization of energy mix. Further, ammonia generation processes are addressed in depth, including blue and green ammonia generation. A survey of ammonia synthesis catalytic materials was conducted and the role of catalyst materials in ammonia generation was compared, which showed that the Ru-based catalyst generated the maximum ammonia after 20 h of starting experiment. An end-use plan for using ammonia as a clean energy fuel in vehicles, marines, gas turbines as well as fuel cells, is briefly discussed to recognize the potential applications of ammonia use. The practical and future end-use vision of energy sources is proposed to achieve great benefits at low carbon emissions and costs. This review can provide prospective knowledge of large-scale aspects and environmental considerations of ammonia.

A plausible way to help tackle these challenges is by developing new plant varieties that have improved crop yield, plant nutritional quality, and sustainability (or resilience) traits. However, stakeholders, consumers, and citizens' concerns and appreciation of future-proofing crops and the acceptability of new plant breeding strategies are not well-established. These groups are actors in the agri-food systems, and their views, values, needs, and expectations are crucial in helping to co-design fair, ethical, acceptable, sustainable, and socially desirable policies on new plant breeding techniques (NPBTs) and the transition to sustainable agri-food systems. In this study, we engaged with consumer experts and societal stakeholders to consider their perceptions, expectations, and acceptability of improving crops and NPBTs for future-proofing the agri-food systems. Our analysis points to a need for governments to take a proactive role in regulating NPBTs, ensure openness and transparency in breeding new crop varieties, and inform consumers about the effects of these breeding programmes and the risks and benefits of the new crop varieties developed. Consumer experts and societal stakeholders considered these strategies necessary to instil confidence in society about NPBTs and accelerate the transition to sustainable agri-food systems. © 2022 The Authors.

Market-based approach has been promoted as a measure to limit the spread and damages by the NIFS and provide economic revenues to fishers. Understanding drivers of NIFS consumption and documenting consumers’ habits are pivotal in guiding a market strategy. Α custom-made online questionnaire was developed and distributed to Greek consumers through Social Media networks. The majority of consumers: (a) supported that NIFS are causing adverse effects to the marine environment (54%), (b) would consume NIFS products if they encountered them on a restaurant menu (62%), (c) would buy and consume NIFS provided they protect the marine environment and indigenous species (76%), and (d) hanker for the implementation of a quality control certificate on NIFS products (79%). Multivariate models revealed that the most important criteria for the consumers except for taste were the freshness of the products, whether the fish is poisonous, and the hygienic conditions of the fish market and its staff. The results reflected the positive attitude of the Greek consumers towards the consumption of NIFS and highlighted the importance of further promoting a market that could improve fisheries sustainability and challenge non-indigenous species (NIS) proliferation. © 2022, The Author(s).","Consumer preferences; Fish market; Fisheries; Social norms",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139040449

Based on a distant and a close reading of Norwegian print media coverage of low energy buildings between 2005 and 2012, we analyse one aspect of this success story: representations of research-based expert authority. Our empirical study is motivated by a concern for expert authority in conflicts that arise when sustainability policies are implemented. We found three distinct, but complementary groups of representations, cautious dissemination of research findings, open engagement in public controversies, and seductive ‘home stories’.

Methods: This prospective, descriptive, monocentric study was conducted over five months. All patients presenting at the retrocession were eligible. After having offered them the pharmaceutical record and having completed it, drug interactions were sought. If the impact was considered significant, a pharmaceutical intervention was transmitted to the referring physician of the institution and recorded in the computerized patient record. Results: The pharmaceutical record was offered to 497 patients, i.e., 87 % of eligible patients. At the first meeting, 7 % of patients (n = 34) were aware of it and 72 % had one open. In total, 395 pharmaceutical records were filled in at least once, 41 of which we created. Only 25 patients (5 %) refused the process and 90 % of the existing records were filled by the pharmacy. In total, 419 prescriptions were analysed for 330 patients: the pharmaceutical record was therefore a useful tool for 66 % of patients. For 17 % (n = 57) of them, or 11 % of included patients, 99 drug interactions with a high risk of clinical impact were detected with the retroceded drug. On average, the presentation, creation and feeding of the drug record took one minute each and the analysis of interactions 14 minutes. Conclusions: Easy to implement, the pharmaceutical record is a useful tool to search for drug interactions with retroceded drugs. It helps to optimize patient follow-up, despite the limited information available. © 2022 Académie Nationale de Pharmacie","Drug interaction; Hospital drugs sales service; Oral cancer treatment; Pharmaceutical interventions; Pharmaceutical record",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139028212

The ratio of NCBN tool flank wear land to the CBN tool flank wear land in dry, wet and MQL methods were 0.18, 0.23 and 0.28, respectively. The wear of CBN tool in turning with MQL was 2.8 times greater than the wear of nano-CBN tool in dry machining. In turning with nano-CBN tool, the height of the tool flank wear with MQL was reduced by 22% and 7% concerning wet and dry methods, respectively, while these values were 51% and 24%, respectively, for the CBN tool.

The key to success has been a private limited liability company in a cross-sectoral partnership between investors from private businesses, the city and third sector organizations. We analyzed business investors motives through a lens of philanthropy, human geography, and social sustainability. We find that investors see their investment as philanthropic, but that traditional motives behind philanthropy are insufficient to describe all motives behind the investment. Instead, we find that investors sense of place, place attachment and city pride was strongly affected by the contested city image in the outside world and a key to their involvement in the project.

Busy outside directors have a positive impact on not just the total ESG score but also on individual components of ESG. The Environment Score is most affected by busy outside directors, while Governance score seems to be minimally impacted.

Due to their extremely low incidence, knowledge on these tumors is scant. Since 2012, the French Very Rare Tumors Committee (FRACTURE) database has recorded clinical data about VRTs in France. This study aims: (a) to describe the tumors registered in the FRACTURE database; and (b) to compare these data with those registered in the French National Registry of Childhood Cancer (RNCE). Methods: Data recorded in the FRACTURE database between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018 were analyzed. In addition, these data were compared with those of the RNCE database between 2012 and 2015 to evaluate the completeness of the documentation and understand any discrepancies. Results: A total of 477 patients with VRTs were registered in the FRACTURE database, representing 97 histological types. Of the 14 most common tumors registered in the RNCE (772 patients), only 19% were also registered in the FRACTURE database. Total 39% of children and adolescent VRTs registered in the RNCE and/or FRACTURE database (323 of a total of 828 patients) were not treated in or linked to a specialized pediatric oncology unit. Conclusion: VRTs represent many different heterogenous entities, which nevertheless account for 10% of all pediatric cancers diagnosed each year. Sustainability in the collection of these rare tumor cases is therefore important, and a regular systematic collaboration between the FRACTURE database and the RNCE register helps to provide a more exhaustive picture of these VRTs and allow research completeness for some peculiar groups of patients. © 2022 The Authors.

Increased industrialization creates demand for new cutting fluids with improved performance. Petroleum based cutting fluids made from mineral oil are generally used to achieve this. Petroleum oil based cutting fluids are cancerous and harmful to both employees and the ecology. In machining, edible vegetable oils have been utilised as a substitute for traditional cutting fluids. Considering the increasing demand of edible vegetable oil, non-edible oils have been shown to have the potential to be used in machining without sacrificing machining performance. The present investigation reports the turning of medium carbon steel on a CNC lathe machine using different cooling conditions and compares the different cooling strategies on the basis of material removal rate, cutting zone temperature, and surface roughness. It has been found from the results that non edible vegetable oil along with minimum quantity lubrication is a good alternative to conventional cutting fluid. © 2022","Minimum quantity lubrication; Non edible vegetable oil","Cooling; Cutting fluids; Gasoline; Lubrication; Turning; Vegetable oils; Cooling conditions; Edible vegetable oil; Experimental comparison; Experimental investigations; Industrial processs; Industrialisation; Integral components; Minimum quantity lubrication; Non-edible vegetable oil; Turning operations; Surface roughness",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139018622

In the case of vegetable supply chains (VSCs), the intensity of challenges is very high due to perishability. Literature suggests various operations research tools for supply chain management of perishables, but there is a paucity of research highlighting the real models adopted by real players in the market while making revenue. This paper investigates and presents how a startup can innovate its business model to meet the VSC issues by adopting a single case study methodology. Design: The phenomenon was studied by convergent interviewing with the company's key personnel and gathering information from the company's key documents followed by content analysis. Findings: The study shows real practices adopted by a startup to cater to the challenges of VSCs in India by incorporating various tools of productivity enhancement and waste reduction. It highlights the adoption of a traceability system, production planning mechanism, reduced food miles, and green initiatives contributing to an innovative business model. The study maps the business model of the startup with the business model concept provided by Lindgardt and colleagues [2009] and states two more dimensions, i.e. ""Client relationship management""and ""Sustainability activities""to expand the mentioned configuration. Originality: The study is the first of its kind to highlight the Business Model Innovation of a startup to address the VSC challenges in the Indian context. Practical contribution: The study has important managerial implications useful for finding our new value propositions in a VSC firm by shortening and effectively integrating the supply chain while minimizing information asymmetry to achieve economies and sustainability. Theoretical contribution: This study has strengthened the methodological advances in the study of business models based upon earlier validated configurations. It contributes to the extant research by adding two more elements ""Client relationship management""and ""Sustainability activities""in a business model configuration. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Business model innovation; challenges; startup; supply chain integration; vegetable supply chain",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139015849

Likewise, the ability to engineer compartment permeability is crucial for in vitro systems to gain sustainability, robustness, and complexity. However, rendering in vitro compartments such a capability is challenging. Here, a facile strategy is presented to build permeability-configurable compartments, and marked advantages of such compartmentalization are shown in reconstituting sustained synthetic biology systems in vitro. Through microfluidics, the strategy produces micrometer-sized layered microgels whose shell layer serves as a sieving structure for biomolecules and particles. In this configuration, the transport of DNAs, proteins, and bacteriophages across the compartments can be controlled an guided by a physical model. Through permeability engineering, a compartmentalized cell-free protein synthesis system sustains multicycle protein production; ≈100 000 compartments are repeatedly used in a five-cycle synthesis, featuring a yield of 2.2 mg mL−1. Further, the engineered bacteria-enclosing compartments possess near-perfect phage resistance and enhanced environmental fitness. In a complex river silt environment, compartmentalized whole-cell biosensors show maintained activity throughout the 32 h pollutant monitoring. It is anticipated that permeability-engineered compartmentalization should pave the way for practical synthetic biology applications such as green bioproduction, environmental sensing, and bacteria-based therapeutics. © 2022 The Authors.

The aim of this study is to analyse the assessment of sustainability indicators related to meal production processes and waste in the food service through a systematic literature review. The hypothesis is that these indicators are still little explored. This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols. The databases consulted were Lilacs, Science Direct, Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, OpenGrey and Greylit. Six different search strategies were applied, combining the terms sustainability and food service, plus manual searches. The search took place until April 2020 and there was no language restriction of the studies. After removing duplicates, 770 publications were identified through the search process, with 44 having been included in this review. Most publications carried out the quantification of food waste (38/44), while in 7/44 there were questionnaires, checklists and water footprint assessments. Most studies identified high indicators of waste, as well as little awareness of sustainability. Factors such as controlled portioning, omnivorous menus and dissatisfaction with the menu were reported to have caused the greatest losses in the process. This review identified a restricted assessment of sustainability in food service, countering the need to deepen these indicators and the effect of meal production processes on sustainable development. © The Author(s) 2022.","food service; food waste; sustainable consumption; sustainable development indicators; systematic review; Waste","Digital libraries; Planning; Surveys; Food sector; Food waste; Foodservices; Future generations; Production process; Production wastes; Sustainability indicators; Sustainable consumption; Sustainable development indicators; Systematic Review; Sustainable development; awareness; catering service; checklist; food waste; human; human experiment; language; meta analysis; questionnaire; review; ScienceDirect; sustainable development; systematic review; water footprint",Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139011186

One of the areas where such impact is noticeable is the textile, apparel, and fashion (TAF) industry. The lockdowns and limited access to retailer outlets resulted in a considerable drop in consumption, creating problems related to the excess of stock, the decrease of sales, and the disposal of non-used items. This paper outlines the implications of the COVID-19 on the TAF sectors and European retailers. It analyzes how the current supply chains exacerbated stock control problems, and it reports on the changes in consumption during the pandemic. The worldwide restrictive measures implemented to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic were responsible for significant profit losses. Also, the decrease in consumption, caused by several geographically wide lockdowns, prompted a subsequent reduction in orders and sales, resulting in a significant number of constraints. The implementation of more environmentally friendly processes, including sustainable circularity as a competitiveness source to keep the TAF sectors in the loop and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, may help address the problems associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in the sustainability context, as reported in this paper. © The Author(s) 2022.","apparel; COVID-19; fashion; supply chains; Sustainability; textile; trend assessment","Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Sales; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Textile industry; Textiles; Apparel industry; Control problems; Current supplies; Environmentally friendly process; European retailers; Fashion; Fashion industry; Subsequent reduction; Textile-apparel; Trend assessment; COVID-19",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139005687

Real-estate as a sector has been historically slow to innovate, particularly in response to pressure from climate change. More recently, the attitude of UK build-to-rent (BTR) developers to carbon is changing, partly due to global initiatives including the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), but also pressure from institutional investors. In this paper, we provide nuanced insight into the emergence of new logics within financialisation's governance in the UK BTR sector and examine how investors attempt to steer developers into adopting low carbon building materials and designs, while identifying barriers. First, we highlight the multiplicity of financialisation's logics wrapped within assets, highlighting the presence of a carbon logic, which creates pressure for low-carbon activity. Second, we contribute to debates on assetisation and financialisation by examining the tools and knowledge used to create low-carbon real-estate assets, and how carbon attributes are ‘retrofitted’ into existing asset classes. © The Author(s) 2022.","Build-to-rent; carbon; financialisation; sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139003222

The impacts of integrating recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) and Ceramic waste are studied for both the rendering and masonry mortar. The various properties of mortar, such as its fresh state properties, mechanical and physical properties and durability-related behaviour, are analysed. The significant findings suggests that increasing the content of RCA as natural river sand replacement reduces the mechanical performance as well as the durability properties of the mortars. However, the durability and mechanical features of the mortars are improved when ceramic fines from diverse sources are included as a partial replacement for natural river sand. The study concludes that the RCA can be used up to 20–25 % and ceramic fines up to 40 %.

Although glove wearing can mitigate the risk of viral transmission especially on high touch points, it is not prevalent due to concerns on diversion of frontline medical resources, cross-contamination, social stigma, as well as discomfort and skin reactions derived from prolonged wearing. In this study, we developed FlexiPalm, a hand-targeted auxiliary personal protective equipment (PPE) against fomite transmission of viruses. FlexiPalm is a unique palmar-side hand protector designed to be skin-conforming and transparent, fabricated from medical-grade polyurethane transparent film material as a base substrate. It serves primarily as a barrier to microbial contamination like conventional gloves, but with augmented comfort and inconspicuousness to encourage a higher public adoption rate. Compared to conventional glove materials, FlexiPalm demonstrated enhanced mechanical durability and breathability, comparable hydrophobicity, and displayed a minimal adsorption of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and virus-like particles (VLP). Importantly, FlexiPalm was found to bind significantly less viral protein and VLP than artificial human skin, confirming its ability to reduce viral contamination. A pilot study involving participants completing activities of daily living showed a high level of comfort and task completion, illustrating the usability and functionality of FlexiPalm. Moreover, we have demonstrated that surface modification of FlexiPalm with microtextures enables further reduction in viral adsorption, thereby enhancing its functionality. An effective implementation of FlexiPalm will bolster PPE sustainability and lead to a paradigm shift in the global management of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in general. © 2022 The Authors.

For the sustainability and growth of SMEs, it is vital to choose the correct long-term projects. Yet, literature shows that SMEs across the globe hardly practice the sophisticated capital budgeting (CB) method. The present study identifies, prioritizes, and proposes a structural model of the barriers to CB practices. The study adopts an integrated method combining the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (F-AHP) and the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (F-DEMATEL) approach to evaluate the barriers to CB practices among SMEs in India. The prioritization obtained through the F-AHP suggests that the knowledge barrier of the decision-makers and the inherent barrier associated with the CB techniques are the most weighted main barriers impeding the practice of CB among SMEs. Also, the most important sub-barriers are time consumption and high complexity of the methods, lack of financial education and training of decision-makers, and lack of computation technology. F-DEMATEL provides a reliable quantitative measure of the association of the barriers to implementing sophisticated CB practices among SMEs. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to identify, prioritize, and structure the barriers to CB practices. Also, it is the first to apply multi-criteria decision-making tools in this field of research. Our findings can help financial managers/practitioners of SMEs to formulate sophisticated CB techniques in their investment decision strategies and efficiently manage their long-term funds. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Analytical hierarchy process; Barriers; Capital budgeting; DEMATEL; Fuzzy",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138970868

Design/methodology/approach: Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on sustainable fashion combined with consumer behavior was conducted. The study approach involved descriptive analysis, content analysis and theoretical analysis in the first section. The later sections focus on sustainability practices across the apparel supply chain that can foster acceptance of sustainable fashion. Findings: In this review paper, five solutions that are typically used for leveraging consumer awareness and acceptance towards sustainable fashion are identified from the latest research papers: (1) attention to micro-sensitive factors (2) shared responsibilities (3) repositioning sustainable fashion for larger audience (4) positioning conscious fashion and (5) unified approach. These solutions are proposed as most important for achieving success in sustainable production and sustainable consumption (SPSC) for the fashion industry. Further, suggestions for how to embed sustainability related business decisions across sourcing, designing, manufacturing, distribution and recollection and retailing are also provided. Practical implications: Through this research, a clear view emerges of the progression of publication and where future research should be directed to popularise sustainable fashion among consumers. Research findings and proposed solutions will be valuable inputs for brand managers, marketers and retailers as they conceive new plans and make decisions about addressing sustainability challenges in textile and apparel manufacturing firms.

As countries adapt BFHI programmes to this paradigm shift away from traditional designation programmes, documenting and sharing policy and programme experience are critical and currently sparse. This qualitative case study included desk reviews of published and grey literature on BFHI programming, national plans and policy documents specific to the selected national responsibilities for universal coverage and key informant (KI) interviews across a range of actors. In the Kyrgyz Republic, the case study explored responsibility 5, development and implementation of incentives and/or sanctions, and responsibility 6 in Malawi, providing technical assistance (TA). In both countries, the three sustainability responsibilities (national monitoring [7] communication and advocacy [8] and financing [9]) as they relate to the universal coverage of the targeted responsibilities were also explored. Thirty-eight respondents in the Kyrgyz Republic described approaches that were used in the health system, including BFHI designation plaques, performance-based financing and financial sanctions. However, currently, there are no formal incentives and sanctions. In Malawi, TA was utilised for national planning and to introduce quality improvement processes. Forty-seven respondents mostly described provisions of TA in building and strengthening the capacity of providers. More programmatic evidence to demonstrate which types of incentives or sanctions can be effective and sustained and more documentation of how TA is provided across multiple aspects of implementation are needed as countries institutionalise BFHI. © 2022 The Authors.

However, government policy and recent technological innovations do not address the digital carbon footprint of organizations. The paper aims to present the concept of single-use dark data and how knowledge reuse by organizations is a means to digital decarbonization. Design/methodology/approach: Businesses in all sectors must contribute to reducing digital carbon emissions globally, and to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first to examine “how” from a knowledge (re)use perspective. Drawing on insights from the knowledge creation process, the paper presents a set of pathways to greater knowledge reuse for the reduction of organizations’ digital carbon footprint. Findings: Businesses continually collect, process and store knowledge but generally fail to reuse these knowledge assets – referred to as dark data. Consequently, this dark data has a huge impact on energy use and global emissions. This model is the first to show explicit pathways that businesses can follow to sustainable knowledge practices. Practical implications: If businesses are to be proactive in their collective pursuit of net-zero, then it becomes paramount that reducing the digital carbon footprint becomes a key sustainability target. The paper presents how this might be accomplished, offering practical and actionable guidance to businesses for digital decarbonization. Originality/value: Two critical questions are facing businesses: how can decarbonization be achieved? And can it be achieved at a low-cost? Awareness of the damaging impact digitalization may be having on the environment is in its infancy, yet knowledge reuse is a proactive and cost-effective route to reduce carbon emissions, which is explored in the paper. © 2022, Thomas W.

Carbon capture and storage can reduce CO2 emissions to a great extent but lacks economic feasibility. The economic feasibility of CO2 capture could be boosted by utilizing the captured gas to produce valuable end products. CO2 is a highly stable molecule; therefore, special catalysts and elevated conditions of temperature and pressure are required for its conversion. This review presents the current status of CO2 utilization processes from various aspects, including thermodynamic, economic, and environmental impacts. The use of process systems engineering (PSE) tools and techniques in a broad spectrum, to improve the technical, economic, and environmental feasibility of these processes, is the major focus of this review.

However, it is unclear whether they are more effective than online texts in conveying knowledge and promoting behavioural intentions. Based on the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, it was hypothesised that videos are more effective than podcasts or texts in communicating nutrition-related information. In addition, differences in behaviour change intentions were explored. The pre-registered online experiment used a 3 (medium: video, podcast and text) × 3 (topic: diet and climate change, sugar content, and nudging) between-subjects design with 320 participants who were randomly assigned to the conditions. After receiving the respective content, the participants' intention to change their behaviour accordingly and their knowledge about all topics were assessed. A mixed Analysis of Variance revealed a significant interaction of topic and knowledge, indicating that knowledge was higher for the topic that participants were assigned to, compared to the two topics they received no information about. There were no differences in knowledge or intention for the three media. Videos, podcasts and texts are equally suitable for conveying nutrition knowledge and may also be equally beneficial for promoting intention. Communicators may thus base their choice of medium on considerations like available resources and preferences of the target group. © 2022 The Authors.

The aim of this project was to test the feasibility and potential effectiveness of a learning collaborative implementation strategy for improving the cross-sector integration of care for people with YOD and to generate data to refine the implementation strategy for scaleup. We conducted a longitudinal mixed methods process evaluation and recruited one representative from three Australian aged care organisations, three disability care organisations and three organisations (n = 9) contracted to deliver care navigation services. One representative from each organisation joined a learning collaborative within their local area and completed a six-module online education package incorporating written resources, webinars, collaboration and expert mentoring. Participants identified gaps in services in their region and barriers to care integration and developed a shared plan to implement change. Normalisation Process Theory was applied to understand the acceptability, penetration and sustainability of the implementation strategy as well as barriers and enabling factors. Dementia knowledge measured by the Dementia Knowledge and Awareness Scale was high among the professionals at the start of the implementation period (mean = 39.67, SD = 9.84) and did not change by the end (mean = 39.67, SD = 8.23). Quantitative data demonstrated that clinicians dedicated on average half of the recommended time commitment to the project. However, qualitative data identified that the learning collaborative strategy enhanced commitment to implementing integrated care and promoted action towards integrating previously disparate care services. Participant commitment to the project was influenced by their sense of obligation to their team, and teams that established clear expectations and communication strategies early were able to collaborate and use the implementation plan more effectively (demonstrating collective action).

Design/methodology/approach: Semistructured interviews with 35 individuals self-identifying as sustainable shed light on motivations and identity expression in sustainable living. Four Drive Theory, and Personal and Social Identity Theory (operationalized through the Dynamic Model of Identity Development), provide this study’s guiding theoretical framework. Data analysis was informed by the Gioia methodology. Findings: Individuals differently express their personal and social identities through sustainable living, and are differently motivated to live sustainably. Those expressing personal identity salience through sustainable living draw on a broader set of motivations than those expressing social identity salience. This results in varying levels of commitment to sustainable living, with differences also found in individuals’ personal satisfaction derived from their sustainable living efforts. Based on these findings, a novel typology of sustainable individuals is developed. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited by its focus on one geographic area and relatively small sample size. A key implication is the need to consider both personal and social identity when studying behavior in other marketing contexts. Practical implications: The research provides important insights for marketing practitioners, policymakers and others seeking to better categorize sustainable individuals and target marketing messages to encourage sustainable behaviors. Originality/value: This paper contributes to marketing scholarship by providing new insights on the role of identity and motivations in sustainable living. It introduces a novel typology of sustainable individuals, founded on differences in identity expression and motivational drives, which are also associated with the range of sustainable behaviors people engage with and how individuals make sense of these behaviors. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Identity; Motivation; Sustainable living",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138875713

However, current seawater splitting faces many challenges because of the sluggish kinetics, the presence of impurities, membrane contamination, and the competitive chloride oxidation reaction at the anode, which makes it more difficult than freshwater splitting. This Review firstly introduces the basic mechanisms of the anode and cathode reactions during seawater splitting. We critically analyze the primary principles for designing catalysts for seawater splitting in terms of both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, including with noble metal, noble metal free, and metal-free catalysts. Strategies to design effective catalysts, such as active site population, synergistic effect regulation, and surface engineering, are discussed. Furthermore, promises, perspectives, and challenges in developing seawater splitting technologies for clean hydrogen generation are summarized. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","Electrocatalysis; Hydrogen Evolution; Oxygen Evolution; Seawater Splitting; Water Dissociation","Anodes; Catalyst activity; Chlorine compounds; Electrocatalysts; Hydrogen production; Oxygen; Precious metals; Reaction kinetics; Seawater; Sustainable development; 'current; Energy sustainability; Environmental sustainability; Hydrogen-evolution; Oxygen evolution; Seawater splitting; Sluggish kinetics; Splittings; Water dissociation; ]+ catalyst; Electrocatalysis",Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138860139

Due to certain properties of nanoparticles (NPs), such as absorption effectiveness, form flexibility, responsiveness, the durability of agrochemicals, superior biocompatibility, concentrated distribution size, and large surface area, nanotechnology has provided a varied variety of roles in crop production. Because NPs directly affect how efficiently inputs are managed, using nanosensors makes it simple to tackle problems in modern agricultural fields. NPs play a variety of roles, including those of fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides, and magic bullets that target particular cell components in plants. Numerous scientific studies have clarified that nanostructured materials affect seed germination, mineral nutrition, and the environment. In this chapter, we discussed how NPs are used to detect agricultural pathogens, monitor crop growth, and reduce environmental pressures to meet the growing demand for crop management that is sustainable. © 2022","Agriculture; Cropping systems; Nanomaterials; Nanoparticles; Sustainable","Agricultural chemicals; Biocompatibility; Crops; Cultivation; Nanostructured materials; Seed; Sustainable development; Agricultural fields; Agricultural system; Crop production; Cropping systems; Large surface area; Magic Bullets; Property; Scientific studies; Simple++; Sustainable; Nanoparticles",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138836860

The parties desire a productive co-management relationship and realize the need to understand perspectives towards fishery management. State and tribal participants were interviewed, with some tribal agency participants being non-tribal member employees. The findings revealed a lack of understanding between the groups for management priorities and a wide cultural distance between backgrounds in either the Indigenous and/or Western knowledge systems. State employees described their qualifications through Western education and individual learning while tribal member employees identified theirs as community experiences and relations with the natural world. The responsibility to manage was described through the public trust doctrine by state participants, whereas tribal participants described sacred responsibilities, and protecting treaty rights and culture. The purpose of fishery management as described by state participants was through sustainability of the resource and harvest while tribal participants spoke of balance within the Circle of Life concept and suggested the term ‘management’ was inappropriate. The tribal agency employees who were non-tribal members, used both knowledge types expressing scientific concepts while using Indigenous expressions learned partially through their normative presence in tribal communities. Opportunities exist for dismantling cultural distance, forming a collective identity, and sharing power, if state governance structures adapt to include Indigenous knowledge and practices. This may require restructuring governance arrangements to promote power sharing and the normative presence of cross-trained employees within the respective communities where structured learning exist and cultural sharing begins. © 2022 The Author(s)","Co-management; Collaboration; Indigenous knowledge; Multi-cultural; Traditional ecological knowledge","Fisheries; Co-management; Collaboration; Consent decrees; Fisheries management; Indigenous knowledge; Knowledge system; Management relationship; Michigan; Multi-cultural; Traditional ecological knowledge; Personnel",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138833941

However, given the vast energy required to activate the CO2 molecule, CCU may have implications on sustainable development that are still poorly understood due to the narrow scope of current carbon footprint-oriented assessments lacking absolute sustainability thresholds. To bridge this gap, we developed a power-chemicals nexus model to look into the future and understand how we could produce 22 net-zero bulk chemicals of crucial importance in a sustainable manner by integrating fossil, CCU routes and power technologies, often assessed separately. We evaluated the environmental performance of these technologies in terms of their contribution to 5 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), using 16 life cycle assessment metrics and 9 planetary boundaries (PB) to quantify and interpret the impact values. We found that fossil chemicals could hamper the attainment of SDG 3 on good health and well-being and SDG 13 on climate change. CCU could help meet SDG 13 but would damage other SDGs due to burden-shifting to human health, water scarcity, and minerals and metals depletion impacts. The collateral damage could be mitigated by judiciously combining fossil and CCU routes with carbon-negative power sources guided by optimisation models incorporating SDGs-based performance criteria explicitly. Our work highlights the importance of embracing the SDGs in technology development to sensibly support the low-carbon energy and chemicals transition. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon capture; Carbon footprint; Chemicals; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Life cycle; Planning; 'current; Bulk chemicals; Carbon emissions; Energy; Environmental performance; Fossil carbon; Power; Power technologies; Route technologies; Trade off; Sustainable development",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138832223

To forestall further ecosystem destruction, nations are working assiduously toward achieving sustainable global environment in decades to come, specifically by 2050. This ambitious goal prompts the convergence of countries in the last climate conference tagged COP26 which provides the roadmap to global sustainability. The resolutions of COP26 motivate the present study to assess the energy transition-led sustainable environment in Gulf countries, considering tourism, transport services, and technological innovation. The study employs annual data from 2005 to 2019 by relying on advanced second-generation estimators comprising cross-sectional ARDL (CS-ARDL), common correlated effects mean group (CCEMG), and augmented mean group (AMG). The study conducts robustness checks using quantile regression (QR) and quantile plots (QP). The results reveal that nonrenewable energy, tourism, and transport services hinder sustainable environment due to their inducing impacts on carbon emissions. Renewable energy and technological innovations promote sustainable environment by moderating the surge in carbon emissions. The QR results reveal that the regressors’ effects are not one-off. For instance, the moderating effects of renewable energy correspond to increasing levels of the quantiles. In contrast, nonrenewable energy posits the opposite, thus confirming the energy transition-led sustainable environment hypothesis in the Gulf countries. Policy implications that drive sustainable environment are suggested based on the findings. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Energy transition; Sustainable environment; Technology; Tourism; Transportation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138830759

However, selecting the best one out of the existing potential alternatives for a particular application is challenging due to numerous conflicting performance measures. To circumvent the above concern, the present work employs a systematic and scientific decision-making framework, i.e., TOmada de Decisao Interativa Multicriterio (TODIM), to select the most suitable structural composite batteries for the development of sustainable earth augers. The risk appetite of the experts involved in the process is captured by the TODIM approach through the parameter known as the attenuation factor (θ).

High market demand has put concerns on its sustainability and conservation aspects in Indonesia. Ninety-five specimens of D. latifolia were collected from eight populations of Java, Lombok, and Sumbawa Island to study intraspecific variability and diversity using SRAP. One hundred and eighty SRAP loci with 54.03% ± 4.35% polymorphism obtained from PCR amplification of 10 primer combinations, with the average PIC for these primers of 0.28. Genetic diversity and variability measures were calculated using GenAlEx software indicating a relatively low-mid level of percentage of polymorphic loci (PPL) (54.03%), effective number of alleles (Ne) (1.255), Shannon information index (I) (0.242), and heterozygosity (He) (0.156) on average. The highest value (I = 0.309, He = 0.196) was observed in population P2CJ (Central Java), followed by West Java of P1WJ (I = 0.300, He = 0.191) and West Sumbawa of P7Wsumb (I = 0.257, He = 0.169), while the lowest (I = 0.202, He = 0.129) was found in West Lombok (P4WL). The genetic relationships were measured from genetic distance and identity from the two-pairwise calculation, PCoA, and STRUCTURE analysis. The relative homologous population is found between populations Central and West Java of P2CJ and P1WJ (Nei uD = 0.031), suggesting these populations have the same origin and formed one population, while the most distinct (Nei uD = 0.157) was recorded between Sumbawa regency (P6Sumb) and East Java (P3EJ). The results from PCoA showed that all individuals are placed in three groups almost in accordance with their respective islands, i.e. a group comprised inclusively trees from Sumbawa island, a group of Lombok and some Central Java trees, and a group of trees from Java with the exclusion of some trees of Central Java that were clustered with trees from Lombok island. This result was also supported by STRUCTURE analysis, which showed that Sumbawa, Lombok, and West-East Java populations formed their respective clusters, and Central Java population contains a mixture of West-East Java and Lombok populations. This may suggest evidence of complex origin, thus needing further study to clarify. It is recommended that the populations with the highest value of genetic diversity (Central and East Java) are to be maintained as the source of the gene pool for genetic enrichment programs. © 2022 The Author(s).

The currently available films like those based on lithium-10,12-pentacosdiynoate or leucomalachite green are either toxic or non-reusable, or both. There is thus a great need for a sustainable solution for radiochromic detection. In the present work, we present a suitable candidate: hackmanite with the general formula Na8Al6Si6O24(Cl,S)2. This material is known as a natural intelligent material capable of changing color when exposed to ultraviolet radiation or X-rays. Here, we show for the first time that hackmanites are also radiochromic when exposed to alpha particles, beta particles (positrons) or gamma radiation. Combining experimental and computational data we elucidate the mechanism of gamma-induced radiochromism in hackmanites. We show that hackmanites can be used for gamma dose mapping in high dose applications as well as a memory material that has the one-of-a-kind ability to remember earlier gamma exposure. In addition to satisfying the requirements of sustainability, hackmanites are non-toxic and the films made of hackmanite are reusable thus showing great potential to replace the currently available radiochromic films. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Gamma rays; Sodium compounds; Exposed to; Gamma exposure; Green is; Hackmanite; Leucomalachite green; Medical physics; Position sensitive; Radiation processing; Radiochromic film; Sustainable solution; Silicon",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138807810

While overcoming the water-related issues, implementation and identifying potential harvesting sites in urban areas on a large scale has always been challenging, necessitating additional research and constraint considerations. The proposed study implements a basin-wide approach and creates a tool using the geographical information system (GIS) to pinpoint site locations to collect rainstorm water. For determining the feasible number of RWH sites, the scenarios were created by considering the minimum basin area. In addition, the volumetric potential of the identified RWH sites was evaluated using the SCS-CN (Soil Conservation Services Curve Number) method by estimating rainfall runoff volume. The proposed methodology is implemented as a case study on the extended area of Jaipur in India, and the analysis shows that all identified locations lie on the outskirts of the study area, ensuring land availability for developing rainwater harvesting structures. As an outcome, the proposed methodology helps to establish the relationship between the basin area, the number of identified RWH sites, and their volumetric potential, creating a benchmark for further conducting similar studies on other areas. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Geographical information system; Hydrospatial analysis; Rainwater harvesting; Scenario development; Volumetric potential; Water sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138806053

However, a scientific and systematic tool is required since there are several available alternatives for metal-air batteries and numerous conflicting performance measures under which the evaluations can be made. To this end, the present work employs a versatile decision-making tool known as TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for Interactive Multi-criteria Decision Making) to appraise the available metal-air battery alternatives and select the best metal-air battery to aid in the development of sustainable agricultural equipment. A total of five alternatives have been appraised under the influence of the following five performance measures: Theoretical cell voltage (C1), Practical operation voltage (C2), Theoretical specific energy density (C3), Practical specific energy density (C4), and cost (C5). From the application of the TODIM methodology, it has been revealed that Li-air batteries are the best alternatives among the considered metal-air batteries that may be employed to develop sustainable agricultural equipment. Theoretical specific energy density has been attached to the highest importance while arriving at the appraisal results. The sensitivity analysis regarding the risk appetite reveals the robustness of the obtained appraisal results and the significance of the risk appetite of the experts while they make evaluations. © 2022","Agriculture; Decision-making; Metal-air batteries; Sustainability; TODIM","Agriculture; Lithium compounds; Metals; Risk assessment; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Agricultural equipment; Decision making tool; Decisions makings; Metal-air battery; Multicriteria decision-making; Performance measure; Performances evaluation; Specific energy density; Sustainable agricultural; TODIM; Decision making",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138804458

The recovery of the by-products of the agri-food chain has also become a priority from a circular economy perspective. Some by-products are still little exploited for the extraction of proteins, such as coffee by-products. In this work, various innovative extraction technologies were applied to recover the protein fraction from the non-compliant coffee green beans (CGB), using a methodological approach that allowed to correlate the process parameters with the final quality of the extracted proteins. The ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) technique has been shown to have a minor impact on the quality of the proteins, thanks to the possibility of refrigerating the system, while the microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) shows a certain degree of degradation due to the high temperatures reached. The results indicate that strict temperature control is required during alkaline extraction to preserve the quality of the protein fraction. © 2022, The Author(s).","Microwave; Proteins; Racemization; Temperature; Ultrasound","Extraction; Sustainable development; Ultrasonic applications; Circular economy; Environmental sustainability; Food chain; Green beans; Green extractions; Microwave-assisted extraction; Process Variables; Protein fractions; Racemization; Ultrasound-assisted extraction; Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138803399

Design/methodology/approach: This paper studies 4,125 research papers on housing prices in the core collection database of WOS. Using VOSviewer, this paper makes a bibliometric and visual analysis of the housing prices research from 1960 to 2020 and probes into the housing prices research from five aspects: time, international cooperation, institutions author cooperation and research focuses. Findings: Keywords such as influencing factors of housing prices, analysis of supply and demand, policy and housing prices and regional cities appear frequently, which indicates the main direction of housing price research literature. Recent common keywords include regression analysis and house price forecast. Countries, like the USA started early in the study of housing prices, and the means and methods in the field of housing price research are mature, leading the forefront of housing price research. Compared with the USA and other Western developed countries, the housing price research in developing countries needs to use innovative research methods and put more effort on sustainability. Research shows that housing price is closely related to economy, and keyword cluster analysis shows that gross domestic product, interest rate, currency and other keywords related to economy are of high-frequency. Research limitations/implications: This paper only uses articles from one database (WOS), which does not represent all research papers published worldwide. Some studies have been published for a long time, and the reference value to the research focuses and future research might be limited. There are many kinds of journals included in the study with different publishing frequencies, time ranges and numbers of papers. These may have some influence on the research results. Originality/value: The main theoretical contribution of this paper is to supplement the current academic research on housing prices.

Traditional thermoset polymers have generally been considered permanently crosslinked materials that are difficult or impossible to recycle. Herein, we demonstrate that by activating ‘dormant’ covalent bonds, traditional polycyanurate thermosets can be recycled into the original monomers, which can be circularly reused for their original purpose. Through retrosynthetic analysis, we redirected the synthetic route from forming conventional C–N bonds via irreversible cyanate trimerization to forming the C–O bonds through reversible nucleophilic aromatic substitution of alkoxy-substituted triazine derivatives by alcohol nucleophiles. The new reversible synthetic route enabled the synthesis of previously inaccessible alkyl-polycyanurate thermosets, which exhibit excellent film properties with high chemical resistance, closed-loop recyclability and reprocessing capability.

Farmers are frequently seen adopting several adaptation measures, which are neither equally efficient nor mutually exclusive. Based on the primary data collected from 300 farming households of the Indian Eastern Himalayan foothills, the present study attempts to examine the efficiency of local farmers’ adaptation by developing indices combining the feasibility, effectiveness, and sustainability of the adaptation measures with the scale of actual adoption. Further, by employing multiple linear regression, the study analyzes the internal (psychological) and external (physical and socio-economic) factors influencing higher scores of these indices. Results show that local farmers are well aware of climate change and are responding through implementing at least one and up to seven adaptation measures. Farmers preferred agroforestry, a shift from cereals to low water-intensive commercials, irrigation, and intensification of winter crops as the most efficient. There was, however, a misalignment between the perceived efficiency of adaptation measures and their scale of adoption. Farmers’ perceptions of pest infestation, satisfaction with farming, soil characteristics, farm size, remittances, and access to credit were found to be positively and significantly influencing the adaptation indices, while open-mindedness toward changing farming practices and crop-raiding by elephants were found to be negatively and significantly associated with adaptation indices. Lastly, the study made relevant recommendations for improving farmers’ efficiency in adopting appropriate adaptation measures and strengthening the “State Action Plan on Climate Change”. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptation; Climate change; Determinants; Farmer; Himalaya; India","Crops; Efficiency; Multiple linear regression; Sustainable development; Adaptation; Adaptation strategies; Agricultural sector; Climatic conditions; Determinant; Farmer; Himalayas; India; Multiple linear regressions; Primary data; Climate change",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138783304

It is estimated that approximately 400 million tons of plastic are produced each year for different applications. This number will be doubled by 2050, which is a serious problem. The primary issue that arises in a recycling process is associated with optimum supply chain management. The comprehensive and transparent supply chain methodologies will help stockholders to make conclusive policies and precise strategies. Transparency in supply chain management assists in captivating planning, pricing, purchasing, and inventory management decisions. Environmental sustainability requires recycling, which should have innovative concepts like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Block-chain Technology. Manual methods of sorting and segregating the waste have outdated and not much efficient. The inclusion of AI and Blockchain Technology brought a revolution by increasing the efficiency and accuracy of the recycling process. This critical review focused on recycling plastics and plastic waste using AI and Blockchain Technology. Various plastic regulation policies and AI utilization for plastic recycling are discussed. An overview of the blockchain and its classification for waste management or plastic recycling has been discussed.

To this end, the study employed instrumental case study design. Five undergraduate SVIs, two special needs educators, an AT service-delivery facilitator, and the resource center coordinator were purposively selected from Haramaya University. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and an observation checklist. The collected data were analyzed by using thematic analysis method and three overarching themes were generated inductively: knowledge and understanding about assistive technologies, availability and access to assistive technology devices and services, and utilization and management of assistive technologies. The study findings show that a lack of awareness among SVIs, instructors, and practitioners in the field; an improper organizational arrangement that dichotomize and diverge student disability services provision from trained professionals in the area; and the absence of policies and guidelines for managing assistive technologies had a negative impact on the availability and utilization of assistive technologies in the University. Thus, it is recommend that the University management, special needs educators, and other concerned stakeholders devise a means to equitably avail assistive technology devices and services for SVIs in the University accompanied by a planned training on its utilization and a coordinated management for sustainability of service delivery. © The Author(s) 2022.","Assistive technology; higher education institutions; instrumental case study design; University; visual impairment",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138777573

Firms expend resources on corporate social programs (CSPs) to promote their corporate social responsibility and sustainability credentials. Stakeholders, however, often respond to such “self-promotion” with skepticism because they believe that there are inconsistencies between corporate claims and actions. This research draws on attribution theory as a framework to examine how the perceived CSP performance of firms by uncontrollable sources are affected when firms disseminate CSP information on firm websites, i.e. a controllable source, where their claims may not be verifiable. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a two-step, mixed method study for the analysis using data from Fortune 500 companies. A qualitative content analysis process identifies the interfaces of CSP and their communications on firms’ website. The process allows the authors to collect CSP data systematically from firm websites and to identify relevant variables through the patterns that emerge from the analysis. The findings are used in a quantitative analysis to study how the patterns underlying CSP communication on their websites affect the ratings of firms’ CSP by independent rating agencies. Findings: Results show that the location, the manner, the content and the scope of CSP information dissemination on firm websites, as well as perceived commitment to CSP identified on the website are important drivers of perceived CSP performance. A robustness check using an alternative independent rating of CSP also provides results that are supportive of the findings. In addition, the effects are found to differ by sector of operation, firm age and profitability. Research limitations/implications: This research suggests that communication of CSPs at controllable sources of firm information dissemination can have a significant effect on the evaluation of CSP at uncontrollable sources when such communication facilitates the assessment of other information from a firm to determine the motive underlying a firm’s CSP. Practical implications: The findings show that firms and managers can influence the perceived ratings, rankings or scores of their CSP by stakeholders when they put the right information at the right place on their corporate websites. One of the findings shows that even moderate levels of CSP commitment demonstrated on firm websites result in positive perceptions of CSP, which has marked practical implications. Social implications: The findings show that integrating even a medium level of commitment to CSP increases the positive perceptions of a firm’s CSP. Thus, society benefits from the firm’s action without a substantial impact on the firm’s profits. Originality/value: This research shows that firm-controlled sources of CSP information dissemination to stakeholders can affect uncontrollable sources of CSP information evaluation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Content analysis; Corporate marketing; Corporate social program; Qualitative analysis; Quantitative analysis; Stakeholder information dissemination",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138766855

However, the high complexity of developing unconventional reservoirs raises many issues concerning the environmental sustainability of this enterprise. In this context, a pre-operational assessment of the groundwater vulnerability is crucial to compound a robust environmental baseline for the shale gas industry. The present study assesses the groundwater’s intrinsic and specific vulnerability of the Indaiá and Borrachudo basins as a part of an environmental baseline study for further shale gas exploration. GOD index method (an overlay and index geoprocessing technique) was applied to assess the aquifer’s intrinsic susceptibility regarding the groundwater confinement (G), the overlying strata (O), and the depth of the groundwater table (D). The specific vulnerability assessment considered the intrinsic vulnerability and the land cover/use of the area, concerning the diversity and the toxicity of pollutants inherent to each anthropogenic activity. The results indicate that 52.69%, 25.12%, and 17.57% of the aquifer area have medium, high, and extreme intrinsic vulnerability, respectively. Medium, high, and extreme specific vulnerability occur, respectively, in 14.37%, 0.28%, and 17.10% of the total area. Specific vulnerability assessment suggests an overall vulnerability reduction due to the basin’s low levels of anthropogenic pressures. Three gas wells overlay moderate intrinsic vulnerability, and one well is above the high vulnerability area.

Four different beverages were elaborated: Pearl Pulp (PRPL), Hawaiian Pulp (HVPL), Pearl Residue (PRRS), and Hawaiian Residue (HVRS). The use of pineapple waste in the production of fermented beverages was feasible, since the beverages presented physicochemical properties according to the legislation. The PRRS sample showed higher acceptance primarily due to its sweet taste, pineapple odor, and flavor. HVRS presented high acid odor and taste as well as bitter taste with high scores for the body due to the relationship with these parameters with dry extract and reducing sugars. This sample also presented high yellow color due to the high phenolic content. HVPL presented high flavor acceptance, probably due to its high alcoholic content and color intensity.

However, both environmental sustainability and sustainable development can be achieved by clean energy (CE) consumption since it consists of noncarbohydrates energy sources that seldom or do not cause CO2 emissions. Therefore, the current study considers economic policy uncertainty (EPU) to study the impacts of CE on CO2 emissions that control economic growth (GDP) and urbanization in both developed and developing nations. The findings from ARDL show that EPU significantly increases CO2 emissions in both the long and short run for both developing and developed nations. While CE and urbanization contribute to improving environmental quality. Economic growth increases CO2 emissions. The results could have a few significant practical impacts on economic policies across which policymakers could try to reduce policy uncertainty by participating in and organizing international treaties and summits. Additionally, international organizations could organize programs to reduce EPU. The role of political stability can be effective in reducing EPU in these countries. Moreover, these nations should introduce environmentally friendly innovation and clean energy technologies and give tax releases on the import and use of CE products while increasing R&amp;D budgets. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Clean energy consumption; CO2 emissions; Economic growth; Economic policy uncertainty; Sustainable development goals",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138762826

It causes many undesirable consequences in the manufacturing processes of almost all types of industries and our daily lives. On the other hand, the separation of charge by contact electrification has given rise to a diverse variety of novel applications, including harvesting energy for generating electricity and technologies related to sustainability and sensing. However, the phenomena of contact electrification are generally poorly understood. In particular, there is a great need to understand the ways to achieve desired levels of steady-state charge. The steady-state charge achieved by frequent periodic contact electrification is arguably the most important quantity required in continuous operation. This perspective discusses the mechanisms and strategies for obtaining the desired level of steady-state charge at all interfaces of matter, including solid, liquid, and gas. Many studies discussed charge generation, but much less consideration has been placed on another important factor that critically affects the steady-state charge: charge dissipation. We describe the importance of the many fundamental mechanisms of charge dissipation. In addition, we present the factors influencing the mechanisms of charge dissipation (e.g., via a toolbox) and the widespread applications of charge dissipation. The importance of charge dissipation thus indicates that the steady-state charge is a balance between charge generation and charge dissipation.

In line with the concepts of economic and environmental sustainability, the disposal of these wastes has become increasingly urgent. This paper proposes a feasible way to use river sediments, sewage sludge, and wheat straw as raw materials for sintered shale bricks. The critical processes of best humidity conditions, molding pressure, and sintering temperature were studied and analyzed to determine the optimal production parameters. Moreover, the physical and mechanical properties were investigated to assess their suitability as a partial replacement for the shale in fired-shale bricks. The results showed that moist mixtures with the maximum dry density, the molding pressure of 2 MPa, and a sintering temperature of 1050 ℃ were the optional condition to sinter high-quality bricks. Overall, the mechanical strength of bricks tended to slightly decrease with the 10–30% substitution of shale by river sediments, which showed a sharp fall with the 1–3% incorporation of sewage sludge and wheat straw, implying that massive organic matters could enhance the porosity of bricks during the sintering process. The bulk density, thermal conductivity coefficient, and drying shrinkage tended to decrease, whereas water absorption increased as three raw materials increased. Additionally, the sewage sludge and wheat straw have a positive inhibiting effect on the sintering shrinkage due to the expansion burned from massive organic matter. At the replacement level of 10–30% river sediments, 1–2% sewage sludge, and 1% wheat straw, bricks with the characteristics of low thermal conductivity, lightweight, and high strength were successfully manufactured according to the Chinese Standards. © 2022, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","River sediments; Sewage sludge; Sintered brick; Sustainable environmental management; Wheat straw","Brick; Environmental management; Organic compounds; Rivers; Sediments; Sewage sludge; Shrinkage; Sintering; Straw; Sustainable development; Economic sustainability; Environmental sustainability; Large amounts; Moulding pressure; River sediments; Sintered bricks; Sintered shale bricks; Sintering temperatures; Sustainable environmental management; Wheat straws; Water absorption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138751005

This study assesses the relationship between vegetation response to climate aridization and the effect of these changes on soil properties, which is crucial for understanding the sustainability of steppe among the trend toward further global warming. Methods: Plant and soil samples were taken in the true, desert and desertificated steppes along a climatic gradient. In the obtained samples, the contents of trace and major were determined. Soil properties that can affect vegetation cover were identified (grain size, pH, carbonates (CO2carb) and soil organic carbon (SOC)). Using the Monte Carlo model, the possible contribution of the studied plant family to the contents of major and trace elements in the soil of steppe landscapes was calculated. Results: The study revealed that during aridization in the steppe zone, there is a change in plant association, which lead to the increases in the biomass and bio-productivity of steppe, and chemical elements associated with salts accumulate in soils (Ca, Mg, Na, S, Sr). The accumulation of Ca, K, Na, S, Cl by arid species leads to further degradation of the soil cover (salinization, forming of cambic horizon) and a decrease in its sustainability. Conclusions: During climate aridification, goosefoot and wormwood would replace grass, which accelerate soil salinization and alkalinization, thus lead to decreasing sustainability of steppe. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Aridization; Chemical elements; Soil; Steppe; Vegetation types",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138747934

Methods: Six electronic databases, 17 Google Advanced searches, and 19 targeted websites were searched for peer-reviewed and grey literature. Literature reporting the financial, environmental, or staffing outcomes of food or food-related waste management strategies that reused, recovered energy from, or recycled waste instead of sending it to landfill were eligible. Document screening and review were completed in duplicate, and included peer-reviewed literature were assessed for quality using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Data were synthesised narratively. Results: Four peer-reviewed and 81 grey literature records reported 85 strategies. When grouped from most to least favourable according to the food recovery hierarchy they managed waste by: donating surplus food (n = 21); feeding animals (n = 2); industrial use (n = 11); composting (n = 34) and other (n = 17). These approaches had the capacity to reduce waste hauling fees (n = 14), reduce staff handling of waste (n = 3), and decrease the amount of waste sent to landfill (n = 85). Barriers included contamination of waste streams, while enablers included leadership and time-neutral changes. Conclusion: This review summarises the waste management strategies used by hospitals worldwide that divert food and food-related waste from landfill, their outcomes, and position in the food recovery hierarchy to enable hospital food services to implement appropriate practice and policy changes to decrease their environmental footprint. © 2022 The Authors.

However, the three disciplines have developed mostly independently, resulting in limited dialogue among them. Emergent fields such as ecological economics and environmental archaeology are now linking the three disciplines and promoting dialogue among them, but a theoretical framework that links all three disciplines at once is missing. I propose that ecosystem services (ES) can serve as such a theoretical framework. Moreover, after an ES-centred framework establishes, it will be capable of further evolving – independently of ES—into a unified superdiscipline, relieving boundaries among disciplines. To demonstrate this potential, I present some examples of archaeology-ES linkages, relating to the past, present and future. I show, in general, how archaeology studies past ES and informs us on current ES, as well as how ES benefit archaeological practice. Thus, I demonstrate the strong interface between archaeology and ES, and how it can promote the dialogue among the three disciplines, provide them with new practical tools, and resolve theoretical issues as the sustainability of ancient societies and anthropocentricity and monetisation of ES.

Concrete consists of various materials of which cement is an essential component, majorly contributing in better bonding between aggregates and contributes in strength. But when it comes to sustainability, this material has contributed about 8% of the total world CO2 emission while manufactured. Proportions of various chemical and mineral admixtures, plasticizers, and fibers were analyzed to achieve high strength, satisfactory durability, and sustainable concrete. Various machine learning (ML) techniques were used for carrying out these tasks. Because of the absence of any empirical relation between the compressive strength of concrete and the new and upcoming concrete mixtures, machine learning techniques have been put to use for the predictions of various mechanical properties of concrete. Numerous ML algorithms right from basic linear regressions to individual support vector regressions (SVR) to ensemble methods like bagging and boosting have been used for which appropriate train-test split is employed for reducing overfitting. We aim to reduce the dearth of knowledge pertaining to this specific domain by our comprehensive research. A number of different ML models are used and critically compared based on their predictions. These comparison results conclude random forest, extra tree, and decision tree regression methods to be the most accurate in predicting the compressive strength of concrete. The highest accuracy of 99% was achieved by this research using the extra tree regressor. It was also able to record an R2 score of 0.937 indicating the ability of the model to capture more complex patterns from the data and to explain the higher variability in the data. The mean absolute error of 2.93 was observed which shows the predicted results’ close proximity to the actual values. © 2022, Qatar University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Compressive strength; Concrete; Machine learning; Prediction","Chemical analysis; Chemical bonds; Compressive strength; Concrete additives; Concrete aggregates; Concrete mixtures; Construction industry; Decision trees; High performance concrete; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Solvents; Chemical admixture; CO 2 emission; Compressive strength of concrete; Concrete; Extra-trees; High strength concretes; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Mineral fibers; Strength prediction; Forecasting",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138739778

To investigate potentials for online PD methods to effectively address these issues, while increasing sustainability, this study examined teachers in Title-I elementary schools spanning multiple school districts participating in a large-scale online PD certificate program preparing teachers over 10 instructional weeks to implement Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) (S)cience, (T)echnology, (E)ngineering, (A)rts, (M)ath (STEAM) curricular instruction with goals of increasing teachers’ science content knowledge, self-efficacy to implement STEAM instruction, and STEAM teaching perceptions. Paired sample t-tests indicate teachers’ life science content knowledge, self-efficacy, and STEAM perceptions increased significantly after completing the online PD. Multiple regression analyses identified teachers’ science content knowledge and STEAM perceptions as statistically significant predictors of teachers’ self-efficacy to implement STEAM instructional strategies. Teachers’ posttest course evaluations were gleaned, highlighting three emergent themes: learning experience design, modality, and online teacher collaboration. Utilizing a mixed method approach, these qualitative insights corroborated the quantitative trends, describing how specific aspects of the pedagogical learning experience design (LXD) framework operationalized in the online course fostered a practitioner development learning environment, focused on supporting teachers’ learning needs.

This inconvenient truth remains unchanged despite the introduction decades ago of participatory approaches and the alignment of aid content, on the belief that they would cure this problem via the generation of a sense of ownership and the reduction in recurrent costs. To understand this paradox, this study re-examines the impact of participation and alignment on the sustainability of aid project output through a field experiment in Uganda using an aid project that promotes household water treatment and safe storage (HWTS) as an example. The results reveal that the true impact of alignment is negative, while the impact of participation is zero. Specifically, when the aid content is changed from nonaligned to aligned while the use of a nonparticipatory approach is unchanged, the rate of HWTS retention drops by 35.4 percentage points after 2 weeks and by 43.7 percentage points after another 4 months. This finding suggests that at least the unconditional alignment of aid content should be reconsidered to prevent the further deterioration of already unsustainable aid project output. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Alignment; Foreign aid; Participation; Sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138727824

It shows that environmental reform requires modern States such as Germany and China to consider certain objective criteria related to the public interest. These criteria are objective insofar as they relate to certain empirically measurable conditions that have arisen in the context of industrialization, and they relate to the public interest insofar as their treatment requires substantial intervention from the State to ensure that economic practices do not endanger the basic natural preconditions of human life. Between the law's instrumentality to the ‘normal’ functioning of modern industrial society and reforms enacted in the public interest, environmental public interest litigation in Germany and China stands out as it implies a possibility for various stakeholders outside of the administrative structure to promote environmental interests. This returns a degree of agency to environmental stakeholders in helping to practically determine the transition towards sustainability. The substantiveness of environmental litigation is assessed, first, in relation to its openness, examining which social actors possess standing to litigate in the public interest, and, second, in relation to its scope, referring to which acts become contestable through the framework of public interest litigation. The court cases, academic debates and legislative reforms surrounding environmental public interest litigation in Germany and China reflect the decisive features of their respective legal ideologies, but they are also an area within which the limits of the dominant legal ideology are tested. © 2022 The Author.

Drinking water may be essential, but it is not necessary to provide it in small plastic bottles. Injections may save lives, but inappropriately discarded syringes are hazardous. Can humanitarian relief be made more sustainable? This paper summarizes a 1-day workshop on this topic, held at INSEAD in 2019 in connection with Luk Van Wassenhove's transition to emeritus professor. This workshop involved over 100 academics and practitioners. Five areas were discussed in detail: material convergence, coordination between humanitarian organizations (HOs), logistics, partnerships with industry, and health. The discussions demonstrate the possibility of better integrating sustainability with humanitarian operations despite the inherent tension between the immediate need to save lives and the longer term perspective associated with sustainability. This requires that various stakeholders, including HOs, donors, and watchdog organizations, think differently about the balance between short-term and long-term interventions, the metrics and incentives they apply, and the role of local versus global organizations.

The milk analogs consisted of the optimum RMB extract, inulin, and Persian grape molasses (as a sucrose alternative) were then fermented by either Lactobacillus casei or Lactobacillus plantarum (0.5 McFarland). The fermentation process also rose the values of some nutrients, including vitamin B (B3, B6, and B9), organic acids, total phenolic compounds, and flavonoids. it decreased the contents of monosaccharides (p &lt;.5), while the increased content of alcohol was negligible (&lt;0.3%). Compared with L. plantarum, L. casei had a higher impact on the production of these bioactive compounds and more considerably increased antioxidant activity of the related beverages; nevertheless, beverages containing L. plantarum had the greatest over-acceptability. Moreover, the survival of L. casei and L. plantarum in beverages was in the standard range (106–108 CFU/ml) during storage, demonstrating that RMB ingredients along with inulin can positively affect LAB survival. Novelty impact statement: The innovative aspect of this work is related to the use of Iranian agricultural byproduct such as BRM and Persian Grape Molasses in production of milk analogs containing Persian type culture collection and the use of subcritical water extraction as an environmentally friendly method for the production of functional beverages. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",,"Agricultural wastes; Extraction; Fermentation; Fermented milk; Flavonoids; Milling (machining); Particle size; Sustainable development; Bioactive compounds; Conventional methods; Environmental sustainability; Flavonoid; L. plantarum; Low-costs; Persians; Shortest Processing Time; Subcritical water extraction; Water extraction methods; Organic acids",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138722637

Special areas such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs, aquifer reservoirs, and salt cave reservoirs are required needed to use this technology and, considering various criteria to decide on these areas is necessary. In this study, the problem of choosing the most suitable CCUS site selection for Turkey is discussed. In the study, for the alternative areas (Adıyaman, Aksaray, Diyarbakır, Afyon, and Tekirdağ) determined, 11 sub-assessment criteria (cost, CO2 state, regional risk, infrastructure availability, reservoir permeability, storage capacity, thickness reservoir, porosity, transportation availability, sustainability, facilities in operation by application) were discussed under CCUS main criterias (carbon capture, carbon storage, and carbon use). The DEMATEL method was used for the weights of the evaluation criteria. Unweighted gray relational analysis (GRA) method and DEMATEL-based GRA method were used to rank the alternatives. According to unweighted GRA results, Aksaray, Adıyaman, Afyon, Tekirdağ, and Diyarbakır decisions are obtained, respectively. According to the weighted GRA results, Aksaray, Adıyaman, Tekirdağ, Afyon, and Diyarbakır decisions are obtained, respectively. Calculation results demonstrated that Aksaray region is the most suitable alternative CCUS area for both methods. The CO amount values for the next period were estimated for this area and evaluated with the auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method by the Minitab. By considering 1013 days of CO data, according to the MA(1) model estimation results were obtained values between 410.899 (μg/m3) and 459.909 (μg/m3). With the installation of the CCUS facility, this value could be checked again by examining it.

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues are therefore gaining increasing importance, in line with the growing demand for corporate sustainability. ESG ratings foster the comparison of companies with respect to their sustainable practices. This study aims to investigate how ESG ratings impact financial performance in the European food industry. Ordinary least squares regression is applied to analyze the relation between ESG ratings and financial performance over a 4-year period from 2017 to 2020. The profitability measures Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) are employed as financial performance measures, while ESG ratings are obtained from the database CSRHub. Results show that higher ESG ratings are associated with better financial performance. Although the effect is modest in the present study, the findings support previous results that ESG ratings are positively related to financial performance. Nonetheless, they also highlight that ESG ratings strongly converge to the mean, which depicts the need to reassess whether ESG ratings are able to measure actual ESG behavior. © 2022 The Authors.

The accurate level of integration along with optimization are all the more reasons to reach this goal of reducing environmental impact and cost alongside increasing the effectiveness. In this research, the heating value of the biomass is increased using two different methods of increasing the heating value: the digestion and gasification process. After that, the fuel is used in a highly effective cycle to generate not only power from the waste heat of the turbine but also the hydrogen from a thermochemical process. The system is analyzed from thermodynamic and economic signposts and the parametric study to define the correct objectives for the optimization. Results indicate that digestion has higher efficiency and lower cost while possessing higher emission at the best operation point. Moreover, the results show that 18.9% lower economic evaluation is reached for gasifier-fueled scheme rather than digester-fueled scheme.

It shows that the mix of cooperation tools contained in bilateral agreements with trade components support in aggregate the Strategy's actions on animal welfare. However, individual bilateral agreements may need to be renegotiated and modernised to include more powerful cooperation tools to achieve sustainable food systems through the adoption and implementation of animal welfare standards. One way of achieving this is to negotiate the inclusion of sustainable food systems chapters that highlight the linkages between animal welfare, agriculture, sustainability, climate, environment, and public health. However, such robust chapters should be monitored and enforced in a correspondingly robust manner, for example, by restructuring chapters' committees and work groups. The article concludes that enhanced public participation, both at the level of legislative proposals (public consultations) and at the level of trade policy (domestic advisory groups, standardisation committees), may better support achieving policy objectves of animal welfare measures of the F2F Strategy. © 2022 The Authors.

Findings reveal, first, how anchoring engineering in girls' embodied experiences supported new forms of participation, new roles for embodied experiences and new making present practices, thereby solidifying a more equitable culture. Second, as the girls moved and hybridized embodied community/STEM ideas and resources, they organized and put into action (through decisions made while “doing” engineering) their values, ideals and desires and that of their communities. Third, we found signifiers, themes, symbols and practices of an emergent engineering culture in which girls positioned themselves as able.

Ecological, spatial, and genetic evidence suggests that there are 2 distinct populations (Boreal and Columbian) that occur in forests at low to moderate elevations in the boreal and central interior regions of the province. In British Columbia, fishers occur at low densities relative to other parts of their range in North America, are trapped for their fur, and are sensitive to habitat change. Despite these factors, little demographic information exists to assist with management decisions for these populations. We collated and analyzed survival and reproductive data from 100 radio-tagged fishers from 5 independent studies conducted between 1990 and 2012 in British Columbia: 2 in the Boreal population, and 3 in the Columbian population. We also collated litter size data from 1 den box study and a translocation project of fishers from the Columbian population. Annual survival rates were not significantly different between the populations or between males and females; however, adult survival rates were higher than subadults (0.79 and 0.63, respectively). Subadult females had significantly lower survival rates than other sex or age classes. Reproductive rates were significantly different between the 2 populations (denning rate = 0.54 [Columbian], 0.82 [Boreal]; (Formula presented.) litter size = 1.7 [Columbian], 2.6 [Boreal]). These differences resulted in net reproductive rates in the Columbian population that were less than half of those in the Boreal population (0.92 kits/reproductive season compared to 2.13, respectively). Population growth rates suggest that the Columbian population may have been declining during the studies, whereas the Boreal population may have been increasing (0.96 compared to 1.20). Consequently, we suggest that focused and intensive habitat and population management for fishers are needed in British Columbia to ensure population sustainability, particularly for the Columbian population. © 2022 The Wildlife Society.","British Columbia; fisher; mortality; Pekania pennanti; population growth; reproductive rate; survival; vital rates",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138686989

Design/methodology/approach: A bibliometric methodology was used, allowing to extract rigorously the relevant literature, leading to a purposefully constructed database of peer-reviewed publications depicting the state of the art in this area. A quantitative analysis of the key characteristics of – and trends emanating from – the literature was performed, and results were presented in a graphic way using the VOSViewer software as a mapping tool. Relevant thematic clusters were identified, and promising future research avenues were identified. Findings: This literature is extremely recent – 90% of the publications are from 2019 and 2020, and the leading journal publishing in this area is the Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management. Key clusters identified relate digital transformation to value chains; a close link is observed between Industry 4.0 technologies and business models; a strong connection to sustainability is also clear; and the implications of Industry 4.0 for human resources management are, not surprisingly, extremely relevant. Originality/value: This is, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the most comprehensive systematic review linking specifically Industry 4.0 to the business and economics literature, bridging with recent, state-of-the-art research in the economics/business and technological fields.

With the governments recognizing the economic potential of shea nuts, there have been various efforts to document the shea nut trade in all major shea producing countries. However, it is still unknown what volumes of shea caterpillar trade occur in Ghana. Our study area includes the five key markets that are popular for shea caterpillar trade in the Bunkpurugu-Nakpanduri district of the North East Region of Ghana. This paper uses qualitative and quantitative data collected through key-informant interviews, guided market surveys, and focus group discussions to shed light on the annual trade of shea caterpillars, their supply chains, the value of the sector, and some sustainability concerns.

Zeolites have been demonstrated to be pivotal catalysts in chemical industries due to their moderate acidity and versatile well-defined pore structures. However, in the context of enhancing the performances of zeolite catalysts, the perspectives on the diffusion regulations within the pores and channels in the bulk phases or external surfaces of the zeolites are often overlooked. Establishing the structure-transport-reactivity relationships in heterogeneous catalysis can provide rational guidelines to design high-performance catalysts. Herein, this tutorial review attempts to systematically depict an integrated picture of molecular transport behaviors in zeolite catalysts from macroscopic to microscopic perspectives. The advances in the accurate diffusion measurements employing both macroscopic and microscopic techniques are briefly introduced. The diffusion characteristics in zeolite catalysts under working conditions (e.g., high temperature, multi-components, and reaction coupling) are then addressed. The macroscopic internal diffusion and the microscopic diffusion occurring in the micro-zones of zeolite crystals (e.g., surface diffusion, diffusion anisotropy, and confined diffusion) are reviewed and discussed in more detail. These diffusion behaviors highly impact the underlying reaction mechanism, catalytic performances, and catalyst optimization strategies. Finally, the multi-type pore systems of practical zeolite catalysts in industrial reactors and their transport behaviors are analyzed. The fully-crystalline monolithic zeolites in the absence of binders are highlighted as rising-star catalytic materials for industrial applications. The research challenges in this field and the potential future development directions are summarized. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Binders; Catalysis; Catalysts; Chemical industry; Diffusion; Pore structure; Chemical production; Energy transformation; Microscopic scale; Molecular transport; Performance; Pores structure; Social sustainability; Transport behavior; Zeolite catalyst; ]+ catalyst; Zeolites",Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138642757

Methods The analysis was based on data from 120 dementia networks that provided information on the network characteristics (location, year of foundation, goals, organizational, personnel and financing structure), the challenges and the use of regional network funding according to § 45c Para. 9 SGB XI. Differences in the organizational, personnel and financing structure depending on the network characteristics were analyzed using t-Tests and ANOVA tests. The use of regional network funding (§ 45c Para. 9) were presented descriptively and discussed against the background of the planned amendment for 2022. Results The majority of networks were established between 2011 and 2015. Most networks had educational and care goals and, on average, 28 stakeholders. Medically-associated and longer-established networks and networks with a legal form had significantly more network partners, persons actively involved in the work of the network and funding sources. The linking of stakeholders and the funding were seen as the most significant challenges. Every tenth network received regional network funding (§45c para. 9) but 28% decided notto receive funding. For most networks (50%), the funding was still unknown. Conclusion Regional dementia networks are very heterogeneously structured. Certain factors can significantly affect the number of partners and funding sources and should,therefore, be considered. Up to now, only one network per region could receive the maximum amount(€20,000) of funding according to §45c para. 9, which limits the usability ofthis funding, especially in densely populated regions. The amendment now increases the number of networks to be funded within one region and the funding level. It remains to be seen to what extent this amendment will increase the use of the regional network funding. © 2022.

Underpricing is a phenomenon related to going public and has been studied from a purely financial perspective. In this paper, we investigate whether underpricing incorporates sustainability performance pre-IPO by establishing an original linkage between underpricing and ESG factors before the firm's listing on stock markets. Using informational asymmetries and quality signaling frameworks, we track the journey of going public by Italian Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) from 2009 to 2017 and show how sustainability issues are incorporated into the IPO underpricing. We demonstrate that underpricing is strongly related to financial and sustainability variables only in the year just before the IPO, indicating better informational efficiency, quality signaling, and image-improving practice. The post-IPO stock return is less correlated with the firm's financial and ESG variables, suggesting that markets can incorporate such information into stock returns in the long run. This paper provides novel insights by delivering an original linkage between a firm's public listing attributes and sustainability performance, offering a temporal tracking of the SMEs before and after the IPO, emphasizing the role of sustainability in the IPO process. © 2022 The Author.

Background: There seem to be differences between creating interventions focused on environmentally sustainable health systems, including nurses, and the scarcity of research on this topic, framed on the Sustainable Development Goals. Methods: A bibliometric analysis was carried out, via three databases (Web of Science, Scopus and Pubmed), and the guideline recommendations were followed to select bibliometric data. Results: The search resulted in 159 publications, significantly increasing the trends from 2017 to 2021 (p =.028). The most relevant countries in this area were the United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden. Also, the top articles were from relevant journals, indexed in Journal Citation Report, and the first and the second quartiles linked to the nursing field and citations (p <.001). Conclusion: Education is key to achieving environmentally sustainable health systems via institutions and policies. Implications for Nursing Management: There is a lack of experimental data and policies on achieving or maintaining environmentally sustainable health care systems, indicating that nurses have an important role and should be consulted and included in decision-making policies regarding sustainability in the health care systems. © 2022 The Authors.

There is no academic review of this field; therefore, this study aims to close this research gap. Design/methodology/approach: The paper systematically reviews the existing literature on sustainability materiality research. Papers were qualitatively classified and analysed in accordance with the theoretical underpinning, research methods and academic themes of sustainability materiality research. Findings: The findings of the review show that scholarly work on sustainability materiality has increased exponentially since the 2010s. In terms of research methods, scholars have examined sustainability using content analysis techniques and qualitative approaches. A common theoretical foundation was missing, but an increasing number of articles have been anchored to stakeholder theory. The academic themes have progressively enriched empirical evidence on the evaluation of materiality in sustainability information.

The performance of geo-materials is evaluated based on the individual sorption and immobilization capacities for various priority substances and pollutants (e.g., lead, zinc, cadmium, copper, arsenic, and others), their availability, and cost-efficient use. A systematic assessment of the sorption potential of geo-materials in comparison to other available sorbents used for the removal of harmful aqueous metal ions is made through a literature review. This paper introduces novel sustainable technologies based on natural and tailored silicate-polymerized substances (geo-materials and geopolymers), and highlights their applicability in the treatment of water and solid matter contaminated by heavy metal ions. The advantages of geo-materials and geopolymers over other commercially available sorbents used for heavy metal ion removal from solution are presented through a literature review. Benefits and current challenges of geo-materials and geopolymers applications in water processing technologies and in environmental remediation are discussed, with recognition of their performance, individual sorption and immobilization capacities, availability, and cost-efficient use. The applications described here comprise: (i) the removal of heavy metal ions from contaminated water using in-situ remediation strategies; (ii) heavy metal ion immobilization through co-precipitation with silicate binders in underground stabilization and waste solidification scenarios; and (iii) a proposal for a new geo-material/geopolymer-based solidification and stabilization technology for efficient, sustainable, and simultaneous treatment of soil/sediment and groundwater at environmental hotspots. Clay-substituted geopolymers, smectite, and zeolites are distinguished by their superb sorption and immobilization capacities for heavy metal ions, while biosorbents can play an important role in the removal of metals, metalloids (e.g., arsenic), and other contaminants. More research on individual removal mechanisms of heavy metals will provide new clues on the development of remediation strategies in advanced scientific and field applications, and on atomic-to-micron scale processes occurring at the solid–liquid interface. © 2022","Clay minerals; Environmental protection; Geo-materials; Heavy metal ions; Sustainability; Water treatment",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138585155

While a win-win paradigm initially arose basically aimed at emphasizing the potential synergies between these two objectives, an alternative vision based on a logic of trade-off has subsequently emerged, foreseeing that improvement in one perspective can often be harmful to the other. Focusing on the EU energy production industry, this study adopts a data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach with the aim to assess whether mutual impact there exists between the economic and the environmental sides reflecting a win-win or a trade-off relationship. Furthermore, as prioritizing sustainability indicators has been recognized in the ongoing debate as a useful way to build effective sustainability practices, our assessment of the mutual impact accommodates the possibility that the resulting evidence may change when priority is placed, alternatively, to the economic or the environmental sustainability concern. The results show how the environmental goal enters in a trade-off relationship with the economic one when priority is placed on the environmental dimension.

Using genomic prediction, genetic gains can be improved through selection for grain quality traits. Abstract: Soils in sub-Saharan Africa are nitrogen deficient due to low fertilizer use and inadequate soil fertility management practices. This has resulted in a significant yield gap for the major staple crop maize, which is undermining nutritional security and livelihood sustainability across the region. Dissecting the genetic basis of grain protein, starch and oil content under nitrogen-starved soils can increase our understanding of the governing genetic systems and improve the efficacy of future breeding schemes. An association mapping panel of 410 inbred lines and four bi-parental populations were evaluated in field trials in Kenya and South Africa under optimum and low nitrogen conditions and genotyped with 259,798 SNP markers. Genetic correlations demonstrated that these populations may be utilized to select higher performing lines under low nitrogen stress. Furthermore, genotypic, environmental and GxE variations in nitrogen-starved soils were found to be significant for oil content. Broad sense heritabilities ranged from moderate (0.18) to high (0.86). Under low nitrogen stress, GWAS identified 42 SNPs linked to grain quality traits. These significant SNPs were associated with 51 putative candidate genes. Linkage mapping identified multiple QTLs for the grain quality traits. Under low nitrogen conditions, average prediction accuracies across the studied genotypes were higher for oil content (0.78) and lower for grain yield (0.08). Our findings indicate that grain quality traits are polygenic and that using genomic selection in maize breeding can improve genetic gain. Furthermore, the identified genomic regions and SNP markers can be utilized for selection to improve maize grain quality traits. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"Genes; Genome; Grain (agricultural product); Mapping; Nitrogen fertilizers; Plants (botany); Sustainable development; Tropics; Condition; Genetic gain; Genome-wide association studies; Genomic regions; Grain quality; Grain yield; Maize (Zea mays L.); Nitrogen starved; Nitrogen stress; Oil contents; Soils",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138577373

Two models were examined to reach the study's objectives. The first model evaluates whether education and ICT are essential for environmental sustainability via potential reduction in carbon emission. On the other hand, the second model fills an existing gap in extant studies by examining the prospect of education and ICT in influencing citizens on the importance of transition to renewable energy usage. Driscoll and Kraay estimator was employed as a panacea tool for cross-sectional dependence and slope homogeneity while the fixed effect approach provides sufficient robustness checks on the findings. While some outcomes vary per bloc, others are relatively similar across the three blocs. Education level in school enrollment perspectives shows a negative significant pollution reduction effect across the three blocs, while only the G7 bloc performed better from human capital perspectives. The combined sample bloc shows that ICT also significantly reduces carbon emission, however, an individual bloc analysis refutes this stance for the MINT bloc. Additionally, while renewable energy cushions emissions in all the blocs, rapid urbanization, shows a positive CO2 emission impact except in the G7 bloc. Last, ICT and education significantly boost renewable energy usage only in the G7. Hence, governments and stakeholders in the blocs should gravitate toward greater investments in quality education and greener ICT infrastructures for a sustainable environment. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","BRICS; education; environmental sustainability; G7; ICT; MINT",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138575987

Evolving regulation has identified prevention and recycling as the best strategies; nevertheless, disposal in landfilling sites plays an essential role since a complete zero-waste scenario is not realistic, currently. Nowadays, policies require a preliminary waste stabilization to decrease the putrescible content. Therefore, mechanical biological treatment (MBT) has replaced the previous crushing, aimed at simple volume reduction. Literature has proved the effectiveness of MBT when MW collection system is ineffective. The present paper considered a facility in an area with a high-performance MW collection system. A long-term (1999–2019) on-site sampling allowed the comparison between two sites of the facility: the old site (before the MBT activation) and the new area, where the stabilized waste is disposed of. Monitoring of biogas, leachate (analyzed parameters: pH, BOD5, COD, ammonia-nitrogen) and odorous emissions was performed to verify the effect of the stabilization process. The considered long period and the on-site sampling support the relevance of the results, compared to the available literature, often referred to as laboratory scale. The results proved the relatively low benefit of stabilization at the considered facility, which cannot justify the energy consumption of MBT. © 2022, The Author(s).","Biogas; Landfill; Leachate; MBT (mechanical biological treatment); Mechanical biological treatment; Municipal waste","Ammonia; Biochemical engineering; Energy utilization; Leachate treatment; Stabilization; Case-studies; Collection systems; Landfilling; Leachates; Mechanical biological treatment; Mechanical-biological treatment; Municipal waste; On-site sampling; Waste collection; Biogas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138559271

Seasonal changes are mainly marked by variations in precipitation patterns. Grasslands are managed as perennial crops and therefore must be resilient to tolerate both dry and rainy seasons. The integration of animal production with the genetic aspects of forages is important for helping to identify resilient alternatives for sustainability in livestock systems. This study developed a multivariate and multiharvesting trial (MHT) for plant height, green forage weight (GFW), and dry matter yield (DMY) in a diversity panel of 130 accessions of guineagrass [Megathyrsus maximus (Jacq.) B.K. Simon & S.W.L. Jacobs] established in the Patía Valley of Colombia. Our study aims to identify interactions among weather conditions and different genotypes for agronomic variables as well as identify outstanding accessions for their productivity and adaptability. The entry mean heritability values were.88,.47, and.39 for the traits plant height, GFW, and DMY, respectively. The genetic correlations among different harvests ranged.5–.9 for plant height and.2–.9 for GFW. Heritability and genetic correlations suggest that plant height and yield are largely influenced by plant genetic effects. The correlation among plant height and yield was.42 for GFW and.33 for DMY. Negative correlations were not found in the agronomic behavior of the materials among the harvests under rainy and dry conditions. The MHT analyzed under the methodology of factor analysis revealed that accessions 16062 and 6982 stood out consistently for plant height, GFW, and DMY across different harvests. These findings strengthen processes in the search for resilient forages in the transition toward eco-efficient livestock production and provide knowledge on which agronomic variables and forage materials to select, according to criteria of interest to both producers and plant breeders. © 2022 The Authors.

Thus, the business community implements practices to protect the natural environment and eliminate its negative impacts. Such corporate practices are placed under the umbrella of the sustainable development concept which pursues multifaceted economical environmental and social goals and more recently the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations' (UN) 2030 Agenda. In this context, this paper aims at examining corporate reporting behavior in the energy sector in relation to SDG disclosures during the first years of the introduction of Agenda 2030. An assessment framework was designed to assess the quality and the range of information disclosed in a set of 105 sustainability reports published during the period 2016–2018. The findings of the empirical analysis led to the conclusion that the examined energy firms did not provide an adequate level of information regarding corporate actions toward the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. Both the quality of disclosed information and the number of disclosure topics were low. SDG4 was the main focus of the reports, with the highest reporting performance, whereas the issues covered by SDG16 and SDG1 were discussed the least in the examined reports. Also, in practical terms, the proposed methodology provides a sound basis for further investigation of the sustainability reporting practices from the energy sector in relation to the scope of SDG. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","corporate sustainability; corporate sustainability reports; GRI; scoring-benchmarking systems; SDGs",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138546584

The recycling of waste glass (WG) in concrete shows great achievements in reducing the quantity of glass. According to researchers’ addition of waste glass in concrete enhances the properties of concrete, WG can be used in any form like powder, fine or coarse aggregate. But from previous studies of different researchers, it has been found that there are some ill effects of waste glass on concrete. This inconsistency of results of waste glass between researchers affects the acceptance (using) of waste glass in concrete structures. To overcome the formal problem the study clarifies the debate of using or not using the waste glass in concrete depending on the analysis of different papers. According to the results concluded from the tests that by partial replacement of cement by weight with waste glass the compressive strength, flexural strength and split tensile strength increases on adding percentage of waste glass as coarse aggregate upto 20%. Above 20% it decreases the strength and durability characteristics of the concrete. It is presumed to enhance the production of recycling waste glass in concrete production and points towards the needs in future for the sustainable development by use of WG in concrete. © 2022","Concrete; Sustainability; Waste Glass; Workability","Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Glass; Recycling; Tensile strength; Coarse aggregates; Concrete; Concrete wastes; Glass wastes; Glasses In; Powder aggregates; Properties of concretes; Recycling of wastes; Waste glass; Workability; Sustainable development",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138545098

By combining the functions of mechanical load bearing and energy storage, structural batteries can reduce the reliance on, or even eventually replace the main power source in an electric vehicle or a drone. However, one of the key challenges to be addressed before achieving multifunctionality in structural batteries would be the design of a suitable multifunctional structural battery electrolyte. The structural battery electrolyte is the constituent that provides mechanical integrity under flexural loads or impact and hence determines the electrochemical and much of the mechanical performance of a structural battery device. This concept paper aims to cover the key considerations and challenges facing the design of structural battery electrolytes. In addition, the main approaches to surmount these challenges are highlighted, keeping design aspects like sustainability and recyclability in view. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","electrolyte; energy storage; mechanical; Structural batteries; sustainable","Bearings (machine parts); Energy storage; Secondary batteries; Battery electrolyte; Conventional batteries; Electric transportation; Emerging trends; Load-bearing; Mechanical; Mechanical loads; Structural batteries; Sustainable; Volume efficiency; Electrolytes",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138540015

The factors affecting the trends in adopting electrical energy generation using sustainable resources: wind, solar, hydro, geothermal and biomass as well as registered all electric vehicles in 50 states and district of Columbia in the USA was analyzed using multivariate linear regression analysis. Eight contributing factors: percentages of high school graduates; college graduates; total population; land area; percentage of water covered area; average annual income and registered democrats in the state were selected as predictor variables. Among eight factors considered, percentage of registered democrats was found as the most influencing factor (p = 0.00543) determining the renewable electrical energy adoption. The transition to all electric cars strongly co-related to higher average annual income of the population (p = 0.00141). In conclusion, an aggressive education campaign by environmentalist and pro-sustainability groups may help in de-coupling the energy and environment policies in the USA from political ideologies in order to achieve a more sustainable future.

The nationwide lockdown and international cargo restriction jeopardized the sector and breaking its marketing chain. Assessing the degree of farming socio-economic peril from COVID-19 and suggesting early coping strategies and long-term mitigation measures are pressing to build resilience for this food production sector. To collect survey data, two key-informant face-to-face surveys with 51 shrimp farmers and 62 consumers in southwest Bangladesh were accomplished. As national lockdowns restricted access to export markets and movements within the country, farm incomes decreased against rising production costs. To compensate, farmers reduced their workforce (29.4%), but even with the sale of co-cultured finfish still suffered from large drops in revenue (42.8% average profit reduction). Furthermore, we present evidence that shrimp farmers should consider diversification of aquaculture product type as co-culture of additional shrimp species was a poor mitigation strategy against large market price fluctuations. Product price reductions were passed on to the consumer, who enjoyed falling product prices including more expensive shrimp products, but the markup for nearly all aquaculture products increased. The current jeopardy and consequences of shrimp farming future are discussed, including coping strategies to help policymakers in building resilience against future uncertainties. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.","Bangladesh; COVID-19; Farm practices; Shrimp industry; Sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138536590

These goals are specifically conceptualized to collectively facilitate the attainment of sustainable socioeconomic development while concurrently improving the quality of the global environment. Hence, this study assesses the interlinkages between economic growth, environmental pollution, financial development, and renewable energy use in light of the objectives of SDG8, SDG13, SDG10, and SDG7 by considering the BRICS nations as a case study. Although the previous studies, in this regard, have predominantly focused on specifically scrutinizing the determinants of these four macroeconomic variables of concern, not much importance was shown to map the interrelationships among these variables. The econometric analysis conducted in this study utilizes quarterly frequency data covering the period from 1990-Q1 to 2020-Q4. Overall, the findings from causality and variance decomposition analyses reveal that in the long run these variables are influenced by each other which, in turn, also verifies the cross-linkages between the four SDG of concern. Besides, the causality-related findings appear to be robust when alternate causality estimators are employed. Therefore, based on these critically important causal relationships, a set of interactive SDG-related policies is recommended. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","CO2 emissions; economic growth; environmental policy; financial development; Granger causality; renewable energy use; sustainable development goals; variance decomposition",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138530132

We consider Petrobras's response both in terms of its visible activities – i.e. in relation to anti-corruption and compliance (“ACC”) disclosures in its annual report (AR) and sustainability report (SR), as well as actioned remedial policies that constitute the crisis plan – and how the company went about interacting with stakeholders during and after the immediate crisis period. We conducted a content analysis of ACC disclosures and assessed Petrobras's remedial activities in the eight-year period 2010–2017 as disclosed in its ARs, SRs and press releases. We find firstly that, consistent with legitimacy theory, Petrobras responded by voluntarily and substantially increasing its relevant disclosures so as to regain legitimacy, a finding which mirrors those found elsewhere following corruption and environmental crises. Secondly, the unique corporate governance situation at Petrobras combined with the fact that leadership was allegedly implicated in the scandal, led the post-crisis management team to undertake a series of remedial actions that prioritised the need to take and maintain executive control and independence from the government, whilst at the same time carefully managing the relationship with this influential stakeholder: - actions which argue strongly in favour of stakeholder-agency theory and multiple agency theory interpretations of the nature of stakeholder interactions that transpired during the crisis period of disequilibrium, and which precluded the type of stakeholder dialogue seen in some previous environmental crisis situations. Finally, we show that Petrobras's crisis management response actions align well with models of trust repair and legitimacy management, and suggest the company considered it had successfully regained legitimacy by 2017. © 2022 British Accounting Association","Anti-corruption; Compliance; Legitimacy; Multiple agency theory; Stakeholder-agency theory; Trust repair; Voluntary disclosure",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138527697

Our study aimed to evaluate the implementation of user embracement in Family Health Units of Jaboatão dos Guararapes, Pernambuco, Brazil. Methods: The studied population belonged to 48 Family Health teams. Eighty-five healthcare workers with higher education answered the questionnaire, and the registration forms of 272 users were examined, from which sociodemographic information was gathered. These data were analysed according to the degree of vulnerability. Questionnaire results were collected and tabulated using the HCMaps software. Dimensions were analysed through a Likert-type grading scale ranging from 1 to 5. This is an evaluative, cross-sectional study with a quantitative approach, considering the dimensions proposed in the RE-AIM framework. Results: User embracement was considered unsatisfactory, as were Reach and Adoption. The Effectiveness, Implementation, and Maintenance dimensions yielded satisfactory results. The main ones were the perception of user embracement as a screening process, and the delimitation of open slots and/or schedules. Conclusions: The study shows that user embracement has been effective in strengthening bonds, reducing queues, and solving demands. However, the potential user embracement sustainability and implementation have been hampered by factors related to the Adoption of the intervention. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Brazil; cross-sectional studies; family health; family health strategy; health assessment; user embracement","adoption; article; Brazil; cross-sectional study; demography; family health; health care personnel; health care system; health center; human; human experiment; perception; Pernambuco; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; software; tertiary education; vulnerability",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138522157

The unsustainability issues are arises due to environmental unease such as climate change, global warming, resource scarceness, and ecological degradation. Circular Supply chain (CSC) has gained momentum in the last few years and acts as one of the sustainable and innovative approach for the manufacturing industry. CSC adoption enhances the social, economical, and ecological aspects of the production and supply chain system. However, very less research has been done on the identification and exploration of numerous challenges to CSC implementation in developing nations, particularly, in India. Thus, this research objective is to explore and evaluate the challenges to CSC implementation in the perspectives of Indian manufacturing sector. Total 24 CSC challenges are recognized through literature review and experts input. This research proposes the Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (PF-AHP) technique. This technique is used to prioritize the challenges of CSC adoption based on their relative importance. The empirical example of an Indian case organization is considered for demonstration of the applicability of proposed method. The result reveals that lack of top management support is the most crucial challenge to CSC adoption. This research outcome acts as a stepping stone for industrial practitioners to adopt CSC efficiently, and effectively. © 2022","Challenges; Circular supply chain; India; PF-AHP; Sustainability","Analytic hierarchy process; Ecology; Global warming; Hierarchical systems; Industrial research; Manufacture; Supply chains; AHP approach; Business organizations; Challenge; Circular supply chain; Ecological degradations; Fuzzy AHP; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy; India; Innovative approaches; Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Sustainable development",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138520975

It is necessary to implement energy production and energy storage in a sustainable way in order to effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve sustainability, batteries must operate beyond their current capabilities in terms of longevity, reliability, and safety. In addition, the chemicals and materials used in the battery must be cost-effective while achieving large-scale production. LIBs (Lithium-ion batteries) are the dominant recharging technology for batteries the next few years, but the problem with lithium-ion batteries is the cost of the materials used to make the LIB. Building batteries from cheaper materials is a challenging task, and investigators are carrying out extensive research on battery technology and battery materials that allow faster charging with superior capabilities. From the literature, it has been observed that nanoscale silicon is a promising material for achieving extremely high efficiency towards the anodic end in the cell because Si contributes the superior speculative anode capacity. This comprehensive review provides an indication of the cutting-edge research on the use of nanoscale silicon as the anode material in lithium-ion batteries. © 2022","Battery; Battery cost; Battery materials; Electric vehicles; Reliability","Anodes; Charging (batteries); Cost effectiveness; Electric vehicles; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Ions; Nanotechnology; Sustainable development; Battery; Battery cost; Battery materials; Battery powered; Energy productions; Environmental pollutions; Greenhouse gas emissions; Industrial segments; Nano scale; Transport energy; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138514394

Of late, banks have focused on sustainable management in order to improve their environmental footprint, to eliminate financial risks, to promote social issues, and to exploit new opportunities. The sustainable development management of organizations attracts new customers over and above conventional institutions thus leading to greater market share and increased revenues. This paper aims to examine if and how sustainable development goals (SDGs) adopted by banking institutions play a role in customers’ decisions and behavior. The way that banks, SDGs, and sustainable image affect customer behavior, attitudes, trust, loyalty, satisfaction, and perceived fair pricing policy is assessed. To this end, 1084 questionnaires were collected and the PLS-SEM method was utilized. The findings show a positive relationship between the stance of banks relating to SDGs and customer trust, loyalty, and perceived fair pricing policy. Finally, the SDGs adopted by banks are an important strategic tool which strengthens relationship with their customers. © 2022, The Author(s).","Banking customers; Customer awareness; Customer trust; Loyalty and behavior; SDGs; Sustainability practices",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138506967

Achieving corporate accountability in this context is also difficult when corporate structures are complex as they operate globally and through supply chains. At the European level, under the Green Deal, the Sustainable Finance Initiative and the Sustainable Corporate Governance Initiative include new reporting requirements to amend and expand the scope and application of the 2014 Non-Financial Reporting Directive, alongside changes to directors' duties to ensure they take account of stakeholders' needs and environmental and human rights due diligence requirements. This paper will argue that these legislative and regulatory efforts are to be welcomed, but the complexity of the regulation threatens to undermine its potential impact. It may therefore be necessary to reduce some of the complexity of the regulatory arrangements. However, some complexity may increase resilience and adaptability for responding to the risks involved in the uncertainty and unpredictability of climate change and in dealing with complex corporate structures. The answer is to provide robust regulation that will prompt the corporate behaviours required to avoid the catastrophic trajectory we currently face. © 2022 The Author(s).","complexity; corporate governance; due diligence; reporting; sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138503697

There is an irony that informal settlements have more of the ideal attributes of smart development, including mixed-use development, high densities, compact affordable housing, modal accessibility, and dense local employment opportunities, than sprawling, low-density single-use developments in surrounding formal developments. Yet, despite their smart characteristics, these informalised settlements are not regarded as ideal spaces to live in due to their informal nature and thus are regarded as unsustainable modes of living. This study critically investigates these assumptions, analysing how informal mixed-use spaces are produced, organised, and regulated organised outside formal planning in a customary land use management system in Cape Town, South Africa, and whether this mode of urbanism is smart, i.e., sustainable. The research results indicate that customary self-regulation of informal settlements creates very liveable, polymorphic spaces in the marginalised townships despite the severe lack of resources. Its smart characteristics are not for aesthetic reasons but to make space functional and personal for the residents. However, the unregulated nature of this new mode of urbanism also limits the accumulation of wealth within the township, and it creates dangerous and unhealthy living conditions for residents in terms of litter, noise, flooding, fire risks, environmental degradation, and anti-social behaviour, especially in public areas not adequately regulated by customary regulatory bodies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Customary land use management; Informality; Smart growth; Sustainable development","Land use; Urban planning; Affordable housing; Cape Town; Customary land use management; Informal settlements; Informality; Land-use management; Self-organised; Smart Development; Smart growth; Sustainable cities; Sustainable development",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138499729

Commercial photovoltaics (PV) have noticeably contributed to getting to 22.1% share of the gross final energy consumption in Europe from renewable sources in 2020 but a steep further increase is urgent in the near future. Over the last few years, great success has been achieved by perovskites applied to PV, with mixed anions and cations in shared lattices that reached record efficiency values close to those of Si in laboratory-scale solar cells (∼26%). Their use has recently shed light on a medium/long-term compositional instability that arises from the partial miscibility of the species with similar role in the atomic lattice. The chemical route to prepare the materials for Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) also needs to be critically reviewed. Material waste and reuse are other concerns to be faced. This perspective paper indeed tackles some aspects for innovation and sustainability on the PSC field for production purposes. Some hints for technologically affordable processes based on in-vacuum deposition of Perovskites are provided in light of their sustainability and for the need to reduce production/maintenance costs. It is also discussed how to make in-vacuum production further competitive by boosting the material quality. Innovation is also projected into the theme of making sustainable choices for device architectures and materials. Carbon-based PSCs are highly focused since they allow avoiding the use of complex, unstable and costly HTLs. From the material side, pros and cons of using fully inorganic CsPbI3 are commented, framed by the current revival of single-cation perovskites. CsPbI3, in particolar, enables recycling and reuse initiatives thanks to the overall mass preservation under degradation. Some closing remarks are provided on the safe use of Pb as its effective sequestration before release from the PSC into the environment is properly engineered. We lastly trust that initiatives bringing together academic and industrial know-how in complementary fields able to take up responsible innovation will contribute to accelerating the ecological transition and will enable the societal transformation to fulfil the 2050 EU agenda for a sustainable future. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Climate change; Energy utilization; Lead compounds; Perovskite; Positive ions; Sustainable development; Technology transfer; Compositional instability; Energy-consumption; Final energy; In-vacuum; Mixed anion; Mixed cations; Partial miscibility; Photovoltaics; Record efficiencies; Renewable sources; Perovskite solar cells",Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138460217

But sustainable development and environmental (in)justice in Palestine/Israel need to be examined through interdisciplinary perspectives that account for the broader settler colonial and neoliberal contexts in which they occur. Taking into account the historical and geographic context of Israel's scientific development, we argue that Israel's green technologies are fundamentally structured by the Zionist project of appropriating Palestinian lands. Within settler colonial analysis, environmental injustice comprises part of a broader pattern of settler domination of Indigenous ecological relations, requiring attending not to ‘equity’ in relations with the state and environment but a reckoning with settler privilege and the return of land to Indigenous communities. We analyze the use of environmental infrastructures—specifically in the areas of waste management, renewable energy, and agricultural technologies (“agritech”)—as mechanisms for land appropriation and dispossession in Palestine/Israel. Our analysis of ‘greenwashing’ as a rhetorical strategy asserts that regardless of the ecological impact of individual technologies, in Israel's settler colonial context they further indigenous dispossession and elimination and are therefore incommensurable with long-term socio-ecological resilience. Through this analysis of Israeli greenwashing, we discuss Israeli sustainability initiatives and technological innovations not as ahistorical discourses, commodities, or technologies, but as elements of a historically situated settler colonial project. © The Author(s) 2022.","environmental justice; green technology; Indigenous studies; Palestine/Israel; Settler colonialism",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138439220

An optimization of these processes by a fundamental comprehension of sorption and mass transport mechanisms in the electrode holds potential to increase sustainability of this technology. The composition of electrodes determines which of these mechanisms govern the interaction of electrodes with water from atmosphere. In this study, the influence of the binder system, temperature, and pressure of Li-ion battery anodes on postdrying is focused on. Anodes with the binder system carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)/styrene–butadiene–rubber (SBR) and polyvinylidene fluoride represent a mostly absorbing and mostly adsorbing material system, respectively. Variation of the process parameters temperature and pressure reveals that both material systems show a similar impact of pressure on water mass transport in the electrode during water removal, although a reduced pressure impact for the CMC/SBR system is expected, since in this case most water is absorbed into the polymers and should diffuse independently of the system pressure. Temperature affects water mass transport in the absorbing material system stronger than in the adsorbing material system, due to the strong temperature dependency of the water diffusion inside the absorbing polymers. © 2022 The Authors.

Impermaculture is a model of urban agriculture whereby some urban farmers approach their impermanence – the possibility of their operations being replaced by higher value developments – less as a threat to be avoided, as traditionally understood in the literature, and more as an intended modus operandi to which they are committed. We discuss how they use lightweight and portable growing containers, planter beds, greenhouses, and livestock pens to operate within and enhance contemporary regimes of development in global North cities. We identify a spatio-temporal impermanence that stands in contrast to classic understandings of sustainability fixes as either a form of greenwashing or as spatial fixes involving the sinking of capital into construction of a ‘greener’ built environment. In what follows, we develop a conceptual framework that will facilitate these contributions and provide a language for discussing cases of impermaculture in Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, British Columbia. We discuss how urban agriculture is mobilized as part of the sustainability fix in the two cities. We first demonstrate how impermaculture emerges as a means of stabilizing the fix which is always prone to coming apart, or fracturing.

However, the transition to sustainable tourism is a difficult task that requires time, money, and the willingness of stakeholders. The aim of this research is to estimate which factors explain tourism companies’ willingness to pay (WTP) the most widely accepted tax instruments, which can be used to finance subsequent policy development related to the sustainability of the destination. The factors that influence WTP of the most accepted instruments are also identified through a logistic regression model. The study was carried out in Andalusia, a popular tourist region in Spain. To this end, a survey was carried out of 916 tourism companies. The results obtained show that the factors that influence tourism companies’ willingness to pay are: commercial activity, business size, and annual turnover. In addition, taxes related to environmental protection generate greater WTP among tourism companies. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Competitiveness; sustainability; tourism taxation; tourist companies; willingness to pay",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138430825

Modern agriculture faces many obstacles as the population is growing exponentially and the rate of food production is unable to keep up. Additionally, to maintain ecological balance, sustainability must be practiced and damage to the environment should be controlled. As a solution to all these problems, nanotechnology has come forward to produce a variety of nanomaterials that assist in agriculture, i.e., nano-pesticides, nano-fertilizers, nano-emulsions, etc. This review focuses on the union of these two disciplines, which will ensure great advancement. Agri-nanotechnology, a new field is born. It provides a detailed overview of certain widely used and important nanomaterials in modern agriculture while elaborating on their application. Agrochemicals can be improved by nanomaterials in terms of efficacy, accuracy, and specific targeting. Through smart and precision agricultural technologies, it is possible to reduce the amount and improve the efficiency of agrochemicals. Advantages include increased sustainability and cost and time efficiency, whereas disadvantages such as potential toxicity and environmental damage still need to be investigated. Through this review, we hope to truly explore the potential for advancement in agri-nanotechnology with new-age nanomaterials, while discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the same.

Neurology. 2022;98(21):e2174-e2184. doi:10.1212/WNL.0000000000200346 Background and Objectives: We conducted a multisite, pragmatic replication trial at 4 New England epilepsy centers to determine the effectiveness of Home-Based Self-Management and Cognitive Training Changes Lives (HOBSCOTCH) in a real-world setting and to assess feasibility of a virtual intervention. Methods: HOBSCOTCH is an 8-session intervention addressing cognitive impairment and quality of life (QoL) for people with epilepsy (PWE). Participants were recruited from epilepsy centers in 4 states and block-randomized into the following groups: in-person HOBSCOTCH (H-IP), virtual HOBSCOTCH (H-V), and waitlist control. Outcome measures were assessed for all groups at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months; intervention groups received long-term follow-up at 9 and 12 months. Results: A total of 108 participants were recruited, of whom 85 were included in this analysis (age at baseline 47.5 ± 11.5 years; 68% female). Participants completing the in-person intervention (H-IP) had a 12.4-point improvement in QoL score compared with controls (p < 0.001). Pairwise comparisons found a 6.2-point treatment effect for subjective cognition in the H-IP group (p < 0.001). There were no meaningful group differences in objective cognition or health care utilization at any time points and the treatment effect for QoL diminished by 6 months. The virtual intervention demonstrated feasibility but did not significantly improve outcomes compared with controls. Within-group analysis found improvements in QoL for both H-V and H-IP Discussion: This study replicated the effectiveness of the HOBSCOTCH program in improving QoL for PWE. The study was conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the distance-delivered intervention may be particularly well-suited for the current environment. Future research will explore modifications designed to improve the efficacy of H-V and the sustainability of HOBSCOTCH’s treatment effect. © The Author(s) 2022.",,,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138426947

In Tlingit, the matrilineal clan—the repository of heritage, identity, and property—constitutes the collective, animate source of resilience, hope, and renewal. We examine the ways in which clans continue to operate as institutions of hope and destiny, especially through the memorial ku.éex’ or “potlatch,” a ritual of restoration and replacement. This ritual is thriving in the 21st century despite no external funding or recognition from the state. It is a wholly Tlingit institution built on socio-geographic values of sustainment of the matrilineal clan as an immortal being. What remains to be re-animated, however, is clan territory. Most Tlingit territory has been appropriated by the Tongass National Forest and Federal and Alaska state waters. Native corporations hold about 2% of the Southeast Alaska land base, and clans hold nothing except, in some cases, recognition of their historical association with particular historic sites and territories. The reinvigoration of cartography with Tlingit place names is a step toward furthering recognition of clans’ historical and contemporary ties to places in a tangible and hopeful way. Yet, culture needs a material base, and mere recognition of traditional toponyms will not be enough. Many clans seek a more substantive livelihood relationships with and custodial role over their territories, not only as sacred properties but as sources of sustainment, strength, and well-being. This requires new thinking on the part of indigenous economic institutions, like Alaska Native business corporations, along the lines of a traditional (Tlingit clan) “house,” an economic unit in the spirit of the original Greek term for economy, oikos (“house”). The integrated restoration of sociocultural, economic, and geographic sources of collective well-being will further enliven Tlingit geographies of hope. © The Author(s) 2020.","Alaska Natives; community development; geography; Indigenous knowledge; sustainability and well-being; Tlingit",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138418519

However, it is questionable whether such lists can grasp a technology’s wide-ranging ethical implications. The bottom-up elicitation of values from the specific technology context avoids problems that predefined lists of values have but has been criticized for lacking an ethical foundation. In this empirical study, we explore how three grand ethical theories of Western philosophy—utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and deontology—can support the discovery of values. Based on three technologies, our results show that ethical perspectives can support IT professionals in identifying values that are not only context-specific but also cater to higher ethical principles (i.e., intrinsic values) and a broad spectrum of sustainability goals (e.g., economic, technical, individual). Each theory of ethics served a unique role in the identification of ethical issues and value potentials of a technology. However, results also suggest a focus on mainstream values and individual values while environmental issues were neglected. We conclude that theories of ethics encourage different perspectives on a specific technology and thus argue for a pluralist ethical basis for values in technology design. © The Author(s) 2022.","empirical study; moral philosophy; technology design; value elicitation; value lists",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138415859

Despite a growing body of knowledge on the distinct characteristics of non-commercial makerspaces, few scholars have analysed them in relation to capitalism. This applies even more to commercial or hybrid makerspaces that remain so far under-researched in diverse economies literature. These spaces, however, can be of increasing interest given what we know about makerspaces as hubs of budding entrepreneurship and that some makers avidly pursue entrepreneurial objectives while others are reluctant to even consider commercialising their projects. In this paper, I employ an extended framework of diverse economies that understands capitalism as not only a form of socio-economic organisation but also a cultural and political architecture. Followed by an overview of existing literature that sheds light on beyond-capitalist dimensions of makerspaces, I explore a case study of the Keilewerf, a hybrid makerspace situated in Makers District in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, disentangling how capitalist, alternative capitalist and non-capitalist ontologies of sustainability-oriented makers co-exist and conflict with economic relations, knowledge production and relations with the state. © The Author(s) 2022.","diverse economy; makers; Makerspace; post-capitalism; sustainable making practices",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138409915

One approach can be focused on replacing fossil-based dyes with renewable and less polluting alternatives. In this sense, this study focuses on validating the suitability of an innovative natural-based blue dye, phycocyanin, sourced from Spirulina platensis microalgae. The laboratory-based experimental approach envisages the exhaustion dyeing of pre-mordanted cotton and bleached wool with phycocyanin-rich extract, representing the sustainable blue dye. The color characterization of naturally blue-dyed fabrics was performed via CIELab coordinates, depth of color by color stregth valures (K/S), values of dye exhaustion, and colorfastness to laundering and light. The results indicate suitable dyeability with the natural blue dye, with process improvements a possibility. The main environmental character of this process was analyzed from the dyeing effluent characterization perspective. Measurements of chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, and metal content were performed on effluents resulting from dyeing processes with variable parameters, to analyze the influence of mordant use, process temperature, time, and pH. Findings indicate that the application of optimum dyeing process conditions results in the lowest oxygen demand values, suitable for further wastewater reuse, according to international industrial effluent limitations. The biological fungi wastewater treatment resulted in the reduction of biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand values by around 80%, comparable with the industrial process, validating the sustainable character of using algae-based phycocyanin in the bath exhaustion dyeing process. © The Author(s) 2022.","biochemical oxygen demand; chemical oxygen demand; metals; microalgae; natural blue dyeing; phycocyanin; Wastewater analysis","Biochemical oxygen demand; Biological water treatment; Dyeing; Effluents; Metals; Microorganisms; Oxygen; Sewage; Sustainable development; Textile industry; Textiles; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Blue dyes; Chemical-oxygen demands; Demand values; Dyeing process; Effluent analysis; Micro-algae; Natural blue dyeing; Phycocyanin; Wastewater analysis; Wastewater effluents; Microalgae",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138398294

Economic growth, a short-term interest, should be integrated with ecological sustainability, a long-term interest, for sustainable development. We used green efficiency and green total factor productivity as proxies for eco-environmental performance. We then utilized a generalized ordered logit model to analyze the relationship between eco-environmental performance and position change among provincial officials in China. For provincial party committee secretaries, the short-term political performance achieved by supporting and investing in non-green economic practices served only to prevent their demotion, as promotions were obtained via improving green efficiency; however, for provincial governors, improving green efficiency can both reduce the risk of demotion and increase the probability of promotion. After the implementation of the new Environmental Protection Law in 2015, improving green total factor productivity can more efficiently reduce the likelihood of demotion among provincial party committee secretaries while enhancing the effects of eco-environmental performance on position change among provincial party committee secretaries. Our study improves the single-oriented, super-efficiency data envelopment analysis model to optimize the process of solving both input- and output-oriented problems simultaneously and realizes efficiency ranking for eco-environmental performance among provincial officials.

In this paper, we argue that policies like California’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act reinscribe the settler state, even as they aim toward environmental sustainability. Drawing from Indigenous feminist scholarship on water and frontier processes, our methodology traces settler colonialism materially and discursively through the movement of water. First, we analyze hydraulic engineering discourses at the turn of the 20th century to illustrate how racial logics were key to producing irrigation—and the broader project of white settlement—as ostensibly benevolent processes of improvement. We then highlight how turn-of-the-century legislation was central to producing agriculture as a site of accumulation by dispossession through the production of settler forms of property and relations with land and water. Finally, we consider groundwater overdraft as a vertical frontier. Thinking with water as an analytic, we study the nexus of relationships that inscribe settler water infrastructures as normative, demonstrating their role as frontier processes within a settler colonial present. Our analysis shows the necessity of dismantling settler modes of sustainability and centering and supporting Indigenous sovereignty. © The Author(s) 2022.","colonialism; environmental sustainability; racial capitalism; Water management",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138391374

Methods: A cross-sectional study with an online survey regularly applied to matriculate women from Medical School in January 2021. Results: Of 277 women, 164 participated. The mean age was 22.26 ± 3.21 years. In all 136 women preferred external pads, 60 internal pads, 28 menstrual cups, and 11 did not use. Using a 1–10 scale, price, efficacy, sustainability, practice, vaginal health status, hygiene, and importance of internal genital integrity were investigated. Thirty-seven (22.56%) women related the use of menstrual cups in the last year. Using any method to reduce menstruation had an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.310 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.122–0.787). Concern about the environmental biodegradation had an aOR of 6.369 (95% CI 1.372–29.562); concern about intimal health had an aOR 1.996 (95% CI 1.183–3.368); and concern about internal genital integrity had an aOR of 0.824 (95% CI 0.682–0.995) for menstrual cup use. Conclusion: The significant independent factors for the use or adherence to menstrual cups were: women using a method to reduce their menstrual flow; concerning biodegradation; concerning vaginal health; with no concerns about manipulating their genitalia.

However, lowering costs and the ability to use a wide spectrum of lower quality lamstock can be critical for this product growth. Off-spec timber often has a significant number of out-plane defects that prevent the lamstock from lying flat and creating an intimate bond between the corresponding CLT layers. This paper aims to introduce a mechanical model to estimate the amount of pressure that makes a warped lumber flat and allow proper contact for an adhesive bond. The difference between experimental and theoretical values were less than 5 kPa for most samples analyzed. The proposed model is an important step to allowing low-quality lumber associated with out-of-plane defects to be further explored by the wood industry in order to create new options for CLT feedstock. This is especially true when considering utilization of small diameter timber (SDT), which is often not considered a viable option for many CLT lamstocks. As a desired outcome, this could minimize losses and optimize industrial manufacturing by using low-quality materials that would positively impact the forest health and mitigate wildfires, while creating economic opportunities. © The Author(s) 2022.","Cross laminated timber; mechanics of materials; prediction model; small diameter timber; sustainability","Adhesives; Defects; Laminating; Lumber; Building applications; Buildings materials; Cross laminated; Cross laminated timber; Laminated timber; Low qualities; Mechanics of materials; Prediction modelling; Pressure predictions; Small diameter timber; Timber",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138389708

First, it is completely dependent on and steeped in fossil fuels and mineral extraction. The historical development of the South African economy's reliance on fossil and mineral resources provides the basis for this dependency but has since tentacularized into the very fabric of conservation and associated wildlife economies in the country. This unsustainable basis of the sector places a major stain on the ways in which South Africa's biodiversity is ‘saved’ for posterity. Second and relatedly, the social and labour relations that make up conservation in South Africa are fossilized in particularly racialized and gendered ways. This is socially unsustainable, as most of these relations are unjust and exploitative. Building on theories of fossil energy and labour relations that emphasise their everyday character, we argue that confronting the fossilized state of conservation in South Africa is necessary in and of itself, and a prerequisite for a broader societal transformation to sustainability. We conclude that the effective chances for this to happen are low, especially given the massive conservation attention on combatting rhino poaching in the last decade. This seems to have reinforced rather than alleviated the status quo. © The Author(s) 2022.","conservation; Fossil fuels; mineral-energy complex; South Africa; wildlife economy",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138345610

This paper introduces a wall-climbing robot for metric concrete inspection that can reach difficult-to-access locations with a close-up view for visual data collection and real-time flaws detection and localization. The wall-climbing robot is able to detect concrete surface flaws (i.e., cracks and spalls) and produce a defect-highlighted 3D model with extracted location clues and metric measurements. The system encompasses four modules, including a data collection module to capture RGB-D frames and inertial measurement unit data, a visual–inertial navigation system module to generate pose-coupled keyframes, a deep neural network module (namely InspectionNet) to classify each pixel into three classes (background, crack, and spall), and a semantic reconstruction module to integrate per-frame measurement into a global volumetric model with defects highlighted. We found that commercial RGB-D camera output depth is noisy with holes, and a Gussian-Bilateral filter for depth completion is introduced to inpaint the depth image. The method achieves the state-of-the-art depth completion accuracy even with large holes. Based on the semantic mesh, we introduce a coherent defect metric evaluation approach to compute the metric measurement of crack and spall area (e.g., length, width, area, and depth). Field experiments on a concrete bridge demonstrate that our wall-climbing robot is able to operate on a rough surface and can cross over shallow gaps. The robot is capable to detect and measure surface flaws under low illuminated environments and texture-less environments. Besides the robot system, we create the first publicly accessible concrete structure spalls and cracks data set that includes 820 labeled images and over 10,000 field-collected images and release it to the research community. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","3D robotic mapping; artificial intelligence; GPS denied; inspection robots","3D modeling; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Concretes; Cracks; Cutting tools; Data acquisition; Deep neural networks; Inspection; Intelligent robots; Semantic Segmentation; Textures; Walls (structural partitions); 3d robotic mapping; Construction inspection; Cutting edges; GPS denied; Inspection robots; Inspection tools; Metrics/measurement; Robotic mapping; Surface flaw; Wall climbing robot; Semantics",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138344591

Despite the significant number of archaeological sites exposed to tropical cyclones and other extreme sea-level events, maritime cultural heritage in the MENA region is rarely included in coastal vulnerability indices or incorporated in mitigation strategies, disaster management, sustainability, and resilience policies. In this study we examine the impact of tropical cyclones on the maritime archaeology of Oman with emphasis on the Dhofar region.

However, its sustainability is vulnerable to various temporal and spatial environmental, socio-economic and political events. In the Zimbabwe case, the politico-economic crises of the 2000s and the COVID-19 pandemic have variedly impacted on the prevalence of tourism with the actors (such as employees, tourists and recreational facility owners) involved in this industry having been seriously impacted. Using the precarity conceptual framework, this article critically analyses the impact of the politico-economic crises induced by the Fast Track Land Reform Programme of the early 2000s and the COVID-19 pandemic on the actors involved in tourism. Information regarding the impact of the political crises and COVID-19 pandemic on tourism in Kariba town is missing in the literature, yet Kariba is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Zimbabwe and Southern Africa. The article discusses the precarity of these tourism actors in the context of the politico-economic crises as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. We define ‘precarity’ as a condition of vulnerability and uncertainty. Our results indicate that for employees, these factors have resulted in uncertainty in the tourism business with some shutting down and others scaling down their operations resulting in redundancy and vulnerability of the workers. For tourists, the successive lockdowns and surge in COVID-19 cases in Zimbabwe resulted in (re)booking and (re)cancellation of bookings; the politico-economic crises resulted in fear among the potential clients and a drop in the number of international tourists. The recreational and accommodation service operators have had the challenge of making food (and other resources) orders for trips that are eventually cancelled due to the surge in the COVID-19 cases.

Literature has shown that the volatility of international agricultural and energy markets has mutual influences, and that these influences may change over time and space. This analysis adds value to the literature by identifying whether, and to what extent, price and volatility spillovers exist between the Canadian wheat market and US corn and energy markets (i.e. gasoline and ethanol). Though many studies have investigated pass-through between corn and energy markets, the addition of wheat markets in Canada is of interest because of the increasing use of wheat in producing first generation ethanol, and the potential for second generation ethanol that could use Canadian wheat straw as a feedstock. Our investigation adopts a modified vector error-correction model with a multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity framework. Key results include: (1) wheat and ethanol prices adjust to a deviation in the equilibrium relationship with corn and gasoline prices; (2) price volatility in the wheat market is only affected by its own shocks, not by the spillovers from US corn, ethanol or gasoline markets; (3) corn price volatility is not affected by shocks to wheat, ethanol, or gasoline markets. However, corn price volatility is largely affected by the covariance between wheat and corn. This information is useful for developing business strategies, as well as for policy makers interested in the development of a second-generation wheat straw-based ethanol industry in Canada. Our results also improve the understanding of impacts of US energy policies on Canada. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Canadian wheat; energy and agriculture; ethanol; Price volatility; spillovers","Agriculture; Costs; Error correction; Gasoline; Power markets; Straw; Agricultural markets; Canadian wheat; Energy; Energy and agriculture; Energy markets; Price volatility; Second generation; Spillover; Volatility spillovers; Wheat straws; Ethanol",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138324549

However, approaches to implementing sustainable development (SD) in higher education institutions (HEIs) themselves remain fuzzy. One way to achieve holistic embedding can lie in organizational culture. This study aims to examine ways by which internal sustainability governance can promote sustainability culture by using empirical data from German HEIs. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses factor analysis to identify relevant governance indicators. With a regression analysis, this study assesses the indicators’ effects on organizational sustainability culture in HEIs. A moderator analysis tests potential determinants derived from literature and their influence on sustainability governance and sustainability culture. Findings: Operationalizing formalized sustainability governance for holistic implementation reveals a gap in sustainability management at HEIs. This study proposes a model for operationalizing sustainability governance and shows an effect on sustainability culture at the formal organizational level.

The purification process of SG employs hydrofluoric acid process, acid–alkali process, high-temperature process, and chlorination roasting process in the latter process. Currently, the most widely used processes in China are the hydrofluoric acid process and the acid–alkali process, but the implementation of China's new environmental protection policy has claimed higher demands on SG production. Aimed at China's environmental policies and the production situation, this article introduces the purification principles and compares processing technology characteristics of the four processes, respectively. A model of the four SG purification processes under the same production capacity is simulated to analyze the main constraints of production including pollutant emissions, raw materials, and energy used. Based on the analysis of the sustainability of the four purification processes, it can be concluded that the high temperature roasting process is the best way to maintain sustainable projects under the condition of overcoming its high cost, according to China. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","natural spherical graphite; purification processes; sustainable development","Calcination; Environmental protection; Environmental technology; Graphite; Hydrofluoric acid; Lithium-ion batteries; Planning; Purification; Spheres; Acid process; Critical factors; High temperature process; Natural spherical graphite; Negative electrode material; Production process; Purification process; Roasting process; Spherical graphite; Sustainable production; Sustainable development",Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138316079

Furthermore, the low compressive strength of lightweight concrete (LFC) has limited its use as structural concrete. In this research, the feasibility of replacing natural mining sand (MS) as fine aggregates in the development of LFC with local agro-industrial waste material, namely palm oil clinker (POC), which can be considered a sustainable material, at different replacement ratios of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% was investigated. Because of the porous structure of POC, a volume-based method was employed in the mix design of using the specific gravities to produce LFC with three different target densities of 1100, 1300, and 1500 kg/m3. The investigated parameters include workability, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, flexural strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. Overall, 100% replacement of MS volume with POC with the sieve size below 0.6 mm resulted in a 90-day compressive strength of 26.7 MPa in the LFC with a density of 1500 kg/m3. Similar to the compressive strength, the utilization of the sustainable POC as fine aggregates slightly improved the tensile and flexural strengths of LFC. On the other hand, replacing 100% of MS with POC with the sieve size below 0.6 mm reduced the flow test results of LFC from 405 to 350 mm. The use of POC in LFC improved the bonding between cementitious material and fine aggregate, according to the UPV results. © 2022 fib.

Sludge bricks (SBs) exhibited compressive strength of 11.03 MPa, 17% water absorption, nil efflorescence, and permissible heavy metals’ leaching, complying with standards as first-class bricks. LCA was performed with the ReCiPe-2016 method, utilizing the primary experimental data, government reports, and the Ecoinvent v3.8 database. LCA analysis revealed that compared to clay bricks, SBs caused 30%, 43%, and 51% lesser harm to ecosystem quality, human health, and resource categories in the endpoint assessment. Kiln emissions, coal, clay, and transportation were chief contributors, but their cumulative endpoint impacts significantly reduced (38%, 52%, 55%, and 45%) on switching to the SBs. Terrestrial acidification, global warming, photochemical oxidant formation, and particulate matter emissions significantly affected midpoint categories. However, their impacts got reduced by 52–57% with SBs. With global annual clay brick production exceeding 1.5 trillion, agricultural soil mining causes irreversible depletion of nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, and organic carbon in the soil. SBs utilize only 50% clay, adding substantially to environmental savings. Successful NCPS immobilization in bricks prevents leaching hazards and avoids scientific landfill construction. With a calorific value of 945 kcal/kg, NCPS acts as internal fuel during firing, reducing the external coal requirement. This work establishes the techno-environmental feasibility of recycling NCPS and producing better-performing bricks with lower environmental impacts.

The current study thoroughly investigates the benefits of using organic cotton fiber instead of conventional cotton fiber. Because of the extensive use of natural resources in the production of cotton, the primary raw material for textiles, which accounts for the environmental effects of a pair of jeans, a life cycle assessment methodology was used to examine these effects in four different scenarios. The additional scenarios were chosen based on the user preferences for washing temperatures, drying methods, and the type of cotton fiber used in the product. The environmental impact categories of global warming potential, eutrophication potential terrestrial ecotoxicity potential, acidification potential, and freshwater ecotoxicity potential were analyzed by the CML-IA method. The life cycle assessment results revealed that the lowest environmental impacts were obtained for scenario 4 with 100% organic cotton fiber with an improvement of 87% in terrestrial ecotoxicity potential and 59% in freshwater ecotoxicity potential. All of the selected environmental impacts of a pair of jeans are reduced in all scenarios when organic cotton is used. Additionally, consumer habits had a significant impact on all impact categories. Using a drying machine instead of a line dryer during the use phase is just as important as the washing temperature. The environmental impact hotspots for a pair of jeans were revealed to be the eutrophication potential, acidification potential, and global warming potential categories during the use phase, and the terrestrial ecotoxicity potential and freshwater ecotoxicity potential categories during the fabric manufacturing including cotton cultivation. The use of organic cotton as a raw material in manufacturing processes, as well as consumer preferences for washing temperature and drying methods, appears to have significant environmental impacts on a pair of jeans’ further sustainable life cycle. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Consumer maintenance habits; Environmental impacts; Jean; Life cycle assessment; Organic cotton; Use phase",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138310117

Particularly, in the case of the construction industry, owing to a large amount of industrial wastage generated and extreme workplace conditions, it is even more important to devise strategies to mitigate the harmful consequences. The most crucial step in this regard is the selection of sustainable suppliers that acquire a pivotal position in the supply chain ecosystem. This study aims to identify indicators for three criteria such as economic, environmental and social, and prioritize them according to their level of significance for sustainable supplier selection in the Indian construction industry. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the best-worst method (BWM) is presented for sustainable supplier selection in Indian construction organizations. Total of 27 indicators was identified for the three criteria of the triple bottom line (TBL) approach namely economic, environmental and social. Using BWM, the most important criterion was found and subsequently, all the indicators under each criterion were ranked in order of importance. Findings: The analysis revealed that the environmental criterion was the most important criteria in the sustainable supplier selection followed by the economic criteria. The indicators that were the most influential in the effective selection process were “Usage of recyclable raw materials for production”, “Adoption of clean and green technologies”, “Waste management” and “Periodical environmental audits” under the environmental criteria; “Efficiency”, “Cost” and “Flexibility and Scalability” from the economic criteria; and “Safety programs” and “Information disclosure” in the social criteria. Research limitations/implications: The study provides a reference framework for the selection of sustainable suppliers in construction organizations. The findings can also be used for the assessment of suppliers' performance in the supply chains.

In steppe ecosystem, changes in soil physicochemical properties affect soil texture, nutrient cycling, etc., which further influence vegetation productivity and change the grazing potential of steppes. Although there are many assessment methods and indicators for studies such as steppe grazing value, there is a lack of studies exploring the relationship between soil physicochemical properties and grazing potential. The main aim of our study was to test how soil physicochemical properties affect steppe grazing potential and how they interact with each other. Methods: In this study, we investigated 220 typical steppe sample plots in the eastern Eurasian steppe and proposed a new method for evaluating steppe grazing potential based on plant palatability, the steppe grazing potential index (SGPI), to examine the interactions between five soil physicochemical properties and steppe grazing potential at three grazing potential levels. Results: We found that soil physical and chemical properties differed significantly at each grazing potential level. At both high and low grazing potential levels, the physical properties of soils played a major role in influencing SGPI. While the relationship between soil function and grazing potential was the strongest at the moderate grazing potential level, mainly, the chemical property SOC had the most significant role. Overall, SGPI is not only directly influenced by SBD and SOC, but also indirectly driven by TN. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that steppe grazing potential is very sensitive to changes in soil physicochemical properties, and its response to soil nutrients and soil texture varies at different levels. SBD and SOC are sensitive indicators that affect grazing potential. Meanwhile, the soil function and potential carrying capacity of grazing production at moderate grazing potential level are also the priority directions for future research. Exploring the relationship between soil function and steppe grazing potential can help restore livestock productivity and ecological balance in steppes with low grazing potential and ensure the sustainability of steppe ecosystem development. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Eastern Eurasian steppe; Grazing potential; Plant palatability; Soil physicochemical property; Steppe ecosystem",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138308859

Like most countries, the pandemic in Canada resulted in various periods of lockdown. The pandemic placed great strain on many establishments and had a major impact on the pre-COVID-19 sustainability initiatives of the Canadian foodservice sector. The purpose of this study was to observe managerial decision-making in Canadian foodservice businesses during lockdown and reopening, focusing on the impact of those decisions on pre-COVID-19 sustainability initiatives. We linked the outcomes to the theory of decision-making by objection during times of crises. This study used semi-structured interviews over a two-month period in mid-2020 with three Canadian foodservice establishments. Our results showed that decision-making impacted the environmental sustainability initiatives in foodservice establishments by imposing a throwaway culture for food and personal protective equipment. The pandemic also impacted social and economic initiatives, created higher operation costs, a complexity of government intervention and the managing of mental health. This study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to develop theories of managerial decisions during crises and disasters that are natural, versus human-based crises, with pandemics situated between those two concepts.

The current uncertainties in our economy—coming from exogenous shocks (e.g., financial crises, political standoffs [US–China], pandemic and Ukrainian war) or from demand for more sustainable activities—affect existing companies and provide opportunities for new ventures. Both type of firms need to think of innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to keep generating value for all stakeholders, and particularly to their customers. The nuanced understanding of the factors describing the current economic situation and their effect on value creation and management affects management by, for example, efficient use of resources, and assists in strategy formulation and decision-making. Customer value creation is a dual concept: creating value for customers (value-to-customer [V2C]) as well as extracting some of that customer value at the same time to create value for the firm (value-to-firm [V2F]). While this might be known, it is rarely implemented. In order to deliver V2C, firms should look at the customer journey from a customers’ point of view rather than a firms’ point of view. Only then, the real revenue potential can be realized when thinking about monetizing the customer interface and, hence, developing the customer relationship options beyond the current business. Even if it exists for a long time already, customer lifetime value (CLV) und customer equity (CE) are the right techniques to measure and manage value in such times. Besides, in today’s environment, the gap between CLV and CE and shareholder value needs to be closed. Existing customer-based corporate valuation studies do exactly so and, more importantly, will become even more important in the future due to new business models. © 2022 SAGE Publications.","CLV; entrepreneurship; strategic decision making; sustainability; turbulent times",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138306567

Thus, to evaluate environmental justice, we proposed a flexible GIS-based multi-criteria model that can be easily adjusted to include other factors to expand the environmental justice context toward other considerations, including the nature of the study area. In this study, the model was applied to Kuwait metropolitan area using four criteria: the proximity of industrial areas, major roads, high-traffic areas, and green areas. The spatial association of these criteria and different demographic groups was explored to evaluate the environmental equality among the groups. The environmental justice index (EJI) varied from 2.43 to 10. The low EJI values covered about 4% of the Kuwait metropolitan area, whereas the moderate and high EJI values covered about 38% and 58%, respectively. The moderate and high EJI areas were fairly distributed in the urban areas compared to the low EJI areas. The findings revealed that the concentrated industrial blocks surrounded by residential areas were one of the most important factors decreasing the EJI values and creating a disparity in the EJI distribution within the urban blocks. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","air pollution; environmental planning; geospatial data; GIS; urban sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138305335

In the literature, common barriers preventing one from conducting garment repairs have been identified. This research re-conceptualizes common repair barriers as repair resources that comprise the skills, tools, priority, and perceived expense that may motivate one toward self-repair, paid and unpaid repair of clothing. A survey of 523 young Canadian consumers (aged 18–34 years) was conducted, in order to examine the impact selected demographic factors and repair resources have on their propensity to carry out different forms of clothing repair. Independent variables were demographic factors and four repair resources, dependent variables were three repair practices. Hierarchical linear regression analyses showed that women were more likely to engage in self-repair, while no gender differences appeared in paid and unpaid repair. Increasing age leads to increased self and paid repair; whereas unpaid repair was more likely to be utilized by the younger consumers. Three repair resources of skills, tools, and priority toward repair strongly predict self-repair. Paid repair is more likely to be utilized if the cost for professional repair services is not perceived to be prohibitive. Young consumers who utilize unpaid repair, while not having the skills, do have access to repair tools and access to skilled resource-rich individuals. The results from this study have implications toward fashion brands, policy and communities in promoting and encouraging various forms of repair practice. © The Author(s) 2022.","barriers; Clothing; mending; repair; resources; sustainability; young consumers","Population statistics; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; % reductions; Barrier; Circular economy; Clothing; Demographic factors; Independent variables; Mending; Resource; Self repair; Young consumers; Repair",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138303152

However, empirical studies on sustainability analysis from local communities’ perceptions are scarce especially on the Afromontane forests. Therefore, this paper analyzes the sustainability of Munessa-Shashemene dry Afromontane natural and plantation forests from local communities’ perceptions. The data were collected from randomly selected 200 households, five key informants, and six focused group discussions. The results revealed that the majority (85.5%) of respondents influenced the sustainability of the Munessa-Shashemene dry Afromontane natural forest based on the current forest product utilization trends and perceptions of the economically preferred tree species in the forest. The forest products have been decreasing over time due to deforestation and degradation of the Munessa-Shashemene forest (93.5%) and economically valuable tree species were substituted by inferior one for various forest products. Consequently, as an area with both general and particularly economically valuable indigenous tree species, the Munessa-Shashemene forest can be sustained by implementing intensive silvicultural operations and enrichment planting for economically favored tree species along with Hagenia abyssinica, Juniperus procera, and Myrsine melanophloeos. Further research investigations are needed on the restoration techniques of degraded preferred tree species to enhance sustainability and reduce future challenges related to forest degradation. © 2022 The Japanese Forest Society.","Attitude; community perceptions; deforestation; forest degradation; sustainability","Conservation; Sustainable development; 'Dry' [; Attitude; Attitudes and perceptions; Community perceptions; Forest degradation; Forest products; Local community; Natural forests; Sustainability analysis; Tree species; Deforestation",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138301399

Accordingly, making the right decision accurately and efficiently based on the most influential criteria is still one of the critical challenges in this area. Among various optimisation issues, sustainable development of renewable energies is one the most crucial in which one of the significant prerequisites is considering the most suitable location for establishing renewable power plants. Based on these motivations, this paper developed a combinatorial multi-criteria decision model using Fuzzy-DEMATEL (FDEMATEL), Fuzzy-ANP (FANP) and Z-number-DEA (ZDEA) methods considering uncertainty and data reliability. For validation of the proposed model, a decision problem is considered for the location selection of a landfill with the aims of managing urban waste, reducing the total cost, improving the efficiency of waste disposal and community social issues. This model considers four indicators, including environmental, economic, social and strategic aspects. In addition, the Crisp-DEA (DEA) and Fuzzy-DEA (FDEA) methods are employed to validate the results using the Non-Parametric Spearman Correlation Test and a sensitivity analysis is performed for the ZDEA model.

The optimized condition of PET hydrolysis was 100°C with 80% v/v aqueous sulfuric acid liquor for 30 min reaction time. The terephthalic acids (TPAs) were filtered out from the reaction mixtures with a sintered glass filter. The viscosity of recycled hydrolysis liquor was measured before it was used in a successive batch of PET depolymerization. The viscosity of hydrolysis liquor increased gradually from 5 mm2/s to 87 mm2/s. TPA yields were obtained from 85.03 ± 0.03% to 99.20 ± 0.06% and the color of TPA changed from bright white to off-white in the final batches. The structure of TPA was confirmed by FTIR, mass analysis, and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. The purity of TPA was found to be 95–98% from the HPLC study via external calibration technique. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) determined the thermal degradation patterns of TPAs and residual weights.

This includes the allocation of costs related to providing access, such as dams, pipes and pumps delivering clean water. Water tariffs are often designed to both recover these costs, meet social needs of water services to the poor, and incentivise conservation in dry times. However, strained public finances, prolonged droughts and economic inequality can undermine these goals and force prioritisations that many see as unfair. This happened in Cape Town, South Africa, during its 2015–2018 water crisis. This study investigates what residents in three different socioeconomic contexts view as fair water tariffs 1 year after the crisis. Using Q method, we describe five distinct perspectives on fairness: ‘the Insurer’, ‘the Individualist’, ’the Bureaucrat’, ‘the Humanitarian’, and ‘the Prepper’. These, we argue, can help distinguish between different ideas of what fairness implies, and what is required to promote it. We exemplify this by examining how viewpoints might have been shaped by specific communities’ experiences during and after the apartheid state’s discriminatory segregation policies. Using distributive, procedural and interactional interpretations of fairness, we discuss how the complex layers of poverty, inequality, mistrust, privilege and discrimination might produce different experiences and ideas of who should pay for and benefit from water services. Using these insights, we also reflect on the merits of tariffs that emphasise cost recovery and resource conservation over social needs, and the risks this poses for growing informal settlements in climate-stressed cities of the global South.

While research in this area has examined critical care in hospitals, less knowledge has been obtained from long-term care contexts such as nursing homes, despite widely recognised challenges with regard to vulnerable patients, increasing workload and maintaining workforce sustainability among nurses. Objective: The aim of this study was to illuminate and interpret the meaning of the lived experience of troubled conscience among registered nurses (RNs) working in nursing homes. Research design: This qualitative research employed narrative interviews with eight nurses to obtain essential meanings of their lived experiences of troubled conscience. The interview texts were analysed using a phenomenological hermeneutic approach. Ethical considerations: Participation was voluntary, informed and was conducted with written consent. The Norwegian Centre for Research Data approved the data processing of personal data. Findings: The analysis uncovered two themes: (1) troubled conscience means abandoning ideals, with the subthemes: failing dependent patients; being disloyal to colleagues; being inadequate in the performance of work tasks and (2) troubled conscience means facing realities, with the subthemes: accepting being part of the system; responding to barriers. Discussion: Troubled conscience meant experiencing continuous and simmering tension between one’s ideals and realities and feeling a drive to preserve accountability and one’s moral integrity. Endangered ideals were often under cross-pressure and included humanistic values, professional values, working life values and the values of the organisation. Conclusion: Nurses’ troubled conscience refers to a struggle, but also a force that plays out at various levels and arenas in long-term care. Openness and dialogue about how professional values and the welfare state’s intentions can be realised within the given framework are important for individual nurses’ occupational health as well as the quality of care provided to patients. © The Author(s) 2022.","lived experience; moral agency; nursing; nursing homes; stress of conscience","adult; article; conscience; human; identifiable information; interview; long term care; morality; narrative; nurse; nursing home; occupational health; personal experience; physiological stress; qualitative research; registered nurse; tension; treatment failure; welfare",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138294345

Much of the energy consumption is in the form of wood biomass, kerosene, and diesel. Africa’s energy demand trajectory points to a future scenario where its contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions will threaten global sustainability. Furthermore, existing supply capacity is unlikely to meet the rising demand for energy. Africa’s transition to renewable energy is needed to balance future energy supply and demand with climate-related externalities. A key barrier to this solution is Africa’s energy ﬁnance gap, which calls for a concerted eﬀort by investors in Africa’s energy markets and governments, as well as global development partners.

For several countries, deeper and more wide-ranging debt treatments will likely be needed to secure future debt sustainability. This paper looks at the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, the largest and most comprehensive debt relief effort for low-income countries to date, as a potential reference point for the 2020s. While the HIPC initiative appears to have been a qualified success, its replication in the current context would be infeasible and undesirable. Creditor base heterogeneity justifies a more flexible, differentiated approach to debt restructuring. Yet, the HIPC experience holds valuable lessons. ""Delay and replay""tendencies should be avoided. Involving commercial creditors is a real challenge, requiring carrots and sticks. And imposing extra conditionality on debt relief proceeds could be helpful but should not be overdone. Even if the Common Framework is unlikely to suffice in case of a systemic debt crisis, its inter-creditor dialogue could perhaps serve as the basis for a more inclusive advisory body or forum for debt restructuring. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2022.","debt relief; Debt Service Suspension Initiative; G20 Common Framework; Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative; public debt",,Conference Paper,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138292586

Although Africa's share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) is minimal, the ensuing effects hit hard on the continent. Hence, the present study provides the first comprehensive empirical assessment of environmental sustainability in Africa within the novel STIRPAT framework. This study critically examines the impacts of natural resource dependence, renewable energy, urbanization, technological innovations, and structural transition on environmental pollution proxied by carbon emissions, ecological footprint, and PM2.5 air pollution from 1990 to 2019 in five top carbon-emitting African countries. The empirical evidence is based on advanced panel estimators comprising CS-ARDL, CCEMG, and AMG robust to cross-sectional dependence (CSD). The quantile regression efficient for exploring the conditional distribution effects is equally employed alongside Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel granger causality test. The preliminary tests reveal the presence of CSD and heterogeneity of the series, which led to the conduct of second-generation unit root and cointegration tests. The main empirical results show that renewable energy, technological innovations, and structural transition reduce environmental pollutants from surging based on the observable negative signs. By implication, these indicators support Africa's path to environmental sustainability. On the flip side, resource dependence and urbanization amplify the surge. The feedbacks from quantile regression provide sturdy support for the main estimators. The granger causality feedbacks support the existence of bidirectional and unidirectional causality among the variables. Based on the findings, policies that promote sustainable environment are formulated. © The Author(s) 2022.","environmental pollution; Renewable energy; resource dependence; technological innovations; urbanization","Air pollution; Carbon; Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Statistical tests; Sustainable development; Cross sectional dependence; Environmental pollutions; Environmental sustainability; Global economies; Quantile regression; Renewable energies; Resource dependences; Structural transitions; Technological innovation; Urbanization; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138292070

Meadow productivity is vulnerable to environmental change, however, because environmental factors often strongly regulate seagrass growth. Understanding effects of grazing and environmental driver interactions on growth dynamics is therefore needed to ensure the long-term sustainability of seagrass meadow foraging habitats. We simulated natural green turtle (Chelonia mydas) grazing by experimentally clipping seagrass for 16 months in a Thalassia testudinum meadow and measured how responses in linear growth, production, the production-to-biomass ratio (P : B; compensatory growth), and leaf area index differed between clipped and unclipped seagrass in response to in situ changes in temperature and salinity. While increasing temperature and salinity had positive and negative effects, respectively, on growth rates, clipping did not alter the relationship between these abiotic drivers and seagrass growth. Simulated grazing did, however, alter effects of temperature on seagrass P : B ratio and leaf area index dynamics. Each increased significantly with temperature; however, P : B ratios only increased in experimentally clipped seagrass, whereas leaf area index only increased in unclipped seagrass. These results suggest that, given temperature-stimulated growth, grazed seagrass prioritizes increasing biomass production, whereas ungrazed seagrass prioritizes increasing photosynthetic surface area. In addition, our results demonstrate that the strength of the compensatory growth response to grazing in T. testudinum is seasonally dependent, highlighting the importance of biotic-abiotic interactions in driving growth dynamics. In a future with increasing grazer abundance and climate-driven stressors, understanding these types of interactions will be critical for long-term sustainability of seagrass ecosystems. © 2022 The Authors.

The author investigated the role of Christian spirituality in switching to and maintaining vegetarian practices. Dietary change is proposed in the sustainability literature as a crucial trajectory to mitigate the impacts of climate change. The purpose of this paper is to explore the links between spirituality and climate-friendly dining in a localised Christian context and discuss their significance further for wider society. Design/methodology/approach: Social practice theory (SPT) provided the tools to explore, empirically, the dynamic development of dietary practice within the farm community and its relation to the outside world; according to SPT, following the main building blocks of practices, namely materials, competences and meanings (cognitive or emotional), helps to understand the evolution of practices in society. Findings: Findings show that the spiritual element of the community's dietary practice is key in maintaining commitment to vegetarianism, despite the rationale focussing exclusively on human health. Social implications: Expanding the rationale to animal compassion and environmental concerns could enhance the stabilisation of the practice within and beyond the community's realms. Originality/value: The research showcases, probably for the first time, how a localised vegetarian practice may be linked to broader societal developments and policymaking through the application of SPT. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adventist; Social practice theory; Spirituality; Tanzania; Vegetarian",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138283312

The study intention of prosperity implies any action, achievement or positive outcome that contributes to informed decision-making and leads to sustainable neighborhood development. Design/methodology/approach: The current research is applied research in terms of purpose and descriptive-analytical, and survey-field in terms of method. The criteria evaluated in this research include criteria as follows: (1) evaluation of protection and preservation of the building, (2) success of the new function and (3) sustainable local development, which are defined items for each criterion. The questions of the questionnaire are prepared according to the Likert 5 points spectrum, the value of which is answered between 1 and 5 and the hierarchy goes from “very good” to “very poor”. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient obtained for the validity of the questionnaire questions is 0.85, which indicates the appropriate validity of the questionnaire questions. Findings: The study findings indicate that the applied criteria are at an acceptable level since the criterion of sustainable local development and architecture have obtained the scores of 4 and the new function criterion scores of 3. Field surveys and observations of changes made in the neighborhood including the construction of a thoroughfare, commercial complex, service complex and local parks verify the validity of the findings.

These studies recognise that how past dryland societies recognised risks and opportunities in drylands, including at times of ecological change (whether climatic and/or anthropogenic) may have been very different from our own notions of post-Enlightenment rationality. They provide examples of very different responses to aridification including: abandoning places and lifeways; specialising in alternative rhythms of life and resources; diversifying and broadening the subsistence base to spread risk; and applying new technological and social solutions to make drylands easier to live in. Whilst emphasising the challenges in both theoretical frameworks and methodologies if we are to better understand the interplay between ecological and social drivers of dryland histories, importantly they demonstrates the capacity of dryland peoples to take both wise and foolish decisions in relation to their own survival and to the sustainability of the natural resource, often with implications for their neighbours.

Yet a review by O'Leary and Torous (2022) revealed the dearth of publicly available evidence-based apps for eating disorders, despite growing research in this area in recent years. The lack of publicly available evidence-based apps is problematic for society and reflects a gap in the research-to-practice translation of the advances that have been made through academic research in this area. We detail barriers that academic researchers face to such translation, including the lack of incentives and pathways for making these interventions available beyond the academic institutions in which they are often created. The effective translation of eating disorder apps, and other digital approaches, from research to practice will require new approaches, including bolstering successful and sustainable translation through partnerships across sectors, being more proactive toward research-to-practice translation, and designing more sustainable digital interventions. Harnessing such approaches can improve the availability of evidence-based eating disorder apps and other digital approaches.

In this context, the aim is to determine the green transportation indicators in companies with corporate identity and logistics activities at the international level in Giresun, Ordu, Gümüshane, Artvin, Rize, and Trabzon in the Eastern Black Sea Region in Turkey. At the same time, the study contributes to providing an effective and applicable solution to decision-making problems involving the assessment of green transportation indicators and smart network strategies in the logistics sector, which is a critical sector for countries. The purpose of this paper is to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This study aims to propose a model for the selection of smart network strategy and to determine the criteria weights used in green transportation indicators, and establish an ideal smart network strategy. In achieving the outlined goals of the study, the authors believe that the model proposed in the study will draw the focus to green logistics which will aid the environmental, economic and social efforts of businesses and governments through the provision of efficient use of scarce resources, which will, in turn, ensure that we leave a sustainable environment for future generations and businesses enjoy a competitive advantage. At the same time, different smart network strategies and green transportation indicators in companies show the success rate of social, economic and environmental indicators in green logistics practices. In addition to providing innovative, reliable and sustainable transportation systems, smart network strategies are critical for businesses to create cost advantages. Through the green transportation indicators and smart network strategies selection model outlined in this study, it is clear that the contribution will not only be limited to businesses, as the society and governments will also benefit from the important indicators on sustainability, as well as the protection of the environment and nature. Findings: According to the findings, “economic indicators” is the essential green transportation indicator in logistics companies with a corporate identity and worldwide transportation operations. Besides, the “mixed access model strategy” is the most appropriate smart network strategy in logistics firms with corporate identity and worldwide transportation activities. Currently, it is possible to assume that logistics organizations prefer to profit from all smart network strategies in terms of cost optimization and competitiveness rather than from just one. The study, on the other hand, which is a road map that will help sustainability practices in the logistics sector due to green transportation, also examines the similarities and differences of green transportation practices in companies in the relevant sector and to what extent they can be reflected. As a result, the study provides a practical road map for selecting green transport indicators and a smart network strategy process for the logistics industry. Originality/value: This study examined logistics companies with a corporate identity and international transportation activities in provinces in the Eastern Black Sea Region such as Ordu, Giresun, Trabzon, Rize, Artvin and Gümüshane.

Movement sympathizers chose to consume products from retailers perceived as supporting movement aims and boycotted retailers thought to be in favor of closer ties with China. This research focuses on the challenges of the yellow economic circle through the lenses of class and consumer nationalism. Drawing on social media posts and interviews with pro-democracy individuals from different socio-economic backgrounds, we highlight challenges to the sustainability of the “yellow economic circle.” Class-based purchasing power represented an obstacle to the success of the yellow economic circle; however, it was not the biggest challenge. Instead, an inherent incompatibility between the movement’s aims and the means for achieving these aims posed the biggest hurdle. Navigating this incompatibility represented an opportunity for movement participants to develop innovations in thinking about consumer nationalism and the role purchasing power may play in participation. We conclude that the way participants defined consumer nationalism determined whether the yellow economic circle could be understood to engender a shared “Hong Kong identity” and eliminate existing class differences. © The Author(s) 2022.","anti-ELAB movement; China; class disparity; Consumer nationalism; Hong Kong identity; political consumerism; yellow economic circle",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138270271

The AURA Strategy is an intervention methodology which focuses on the regeneration of neighbourhoods or obsolete urban fabrics which suffer from high levels of architectural, urban and socio-economic vulnerability. Within this context, the AURA 3.1 prototype was developed for the Solar Decathlon Europe 2019 Competition. The project was based around a sustainable construction strategy for the urban regeneration of obsolete residential neighbourhoods, through the reuse of existing buildings considering Mediterranean climate and energy. The Poligono San Pablo neighbourhood was chosen as the case study. This article presents the main retrofit action: the juxtaposition on the existing building of a structural-architectural system which provides new technological and spatial features. Quantitative data regarding the validity and effectiveness of the AURA Strategy could be collected from the monitoring of the Pavilion prototype during the competition. Two first prizes were won in contests with on-site measurements: Comfort conditions and House Functioning. Third place was also obtained in the Sustainability contest, thus confirming the enormous possibilities the AURA Strategy has for sustainable urban regeneration in retrofitting social housing, within the limitations of the competition. © 2022, The Author(s).","Comfort; Housing function; Modular extensions; Retrofitting social housing; Solar decathlon; Sustainability; Urban regeneration",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138265495

The model selects suppliers and determines sustainability investments and order allocations among the selected suppliers. High sustainability performance, as well as cost efficiency, is achieved while a high operational performance level is maintained. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear bi-objective integer-programming model, discover the model’s special features, and propose an effective and computationally efficient algorithm to solve it. To quantify a supply chain’s sustainability performance, we adopt the Environmental, Social, and Governance index. Instead of searching for just one sourcing solution, we find the Pareto-optimal set of effective solutions. Numerical tests verify that our algorithm outperforms an existing sourcing algorithm in terms of computational efficiency. A simulation of Apple’s sourcing decisions demonstrates the effectiveness of the model in business practice. Our work also provides managerial insights on how sustainable operations alter traditional supply chain sourcing decisions.

Drought policy represents one sector where the Australian government is a signatory to sustainable use of natural resources, cognisant of the nexus between agricultural production practices and environmental condition. A strategic sustainability policy evaluation framework is applied to drought policy to analyse policy design and process relationships with a view to informing improvements in these policy facets. The analysis finds that at the national level, the nature of the policy problem is inadequately defined, giving rise to generic objectives and overly narrow policy instrument choices that are inconsistent with the complex nature of drought and resilience objectives. Policy instrument choice is focussed on farm financial viability, with simplistic correlations drawn between farm profitability and improved social and environmental wellbeing. The appetite for broader structural reforms to agricultural and rural community development are lacking politically and by industry, but necessary given emerging social, economic and environmental challenges to agriculture. Structural reforms will be inevitable if the complexities between production and sustainable natural resource management are to be reconciled.

Little is known of how foragers themselves define and ensure sustainable foraging. Here, we collaboratively assessed the activities and motivations of the forager community in Norway in order to achieve a combined social and ecological assessment of foraging sustainability. Current foraging of wild food plants in Norway contributes to an increased appreciation of nature rather than generating negative environmental impact and is hence an opportunity for sustainable development. Summary: Wild food plants are well recognized as local sources of nutrition that can contribute to food security, but foraging is sometimes viewed as a threat to biological conservation. Here, we characterize and assess sustainable foraging in Norway through transdisciplinary research co-constructed with the Norwegian Association for Mycology and Foraging. We conducted 19 face-to-face interviews with key stakeholders and produced an online questionnaire returned by 219 recreational and commercial foragers to enquire about what species are harvested, by whom and how, where do foragers learn and what are their perspectives on the sustainability of foraging. Foraging fosters a strong connection with the natural environment. Foragers decide when and how much can be harvested considering location, plant and plant part being harvested. They pay attention to native plants' conservation status and local abundance and plant individual's survival after foraging and aim to not spread invasive species. We define sustainable foraging as the knowledge and practices that enable enriching forager–biodiversity relationships over time. Such a definition can support collaborative sustainability efforts between the academic community and civil society. © 2022 The Authors.

Therefore, a balance between composite performance and biodegradability is required with approaches to what one might call an eco-friendly composite. This review provides an overview of sustainable FRP composites, their manufacturing techniques, and sustainability in general at materials, manufacturing, and end-of-life levels. Sustainable plant-based natural fibers and polymer matrices are also summarized, followed by an overview of their modification techniques to obtain high-performance, multifunctional, and sustainable FRP composites.

After a remarkable and somewhat chaotic development in the early 1990s, European aquaculture has been evolving in both scientific and policy domains to improve, and to prove, its sustainability. The updated review of the literature and policy framework presented in this article highlights gaps in European studies, addressing mostly concerns over environmental impacts and food safety and less over economic impacts on other coastal activities or the effects on social values and local traditions. The analysis of the legislative framework demonstrates that the existing legislation adopted at different levels addresses most of the criteria of social acceptability through binding rules and supporting guidelines. Nonetheless, some elements of social concerns, such as the impact of escapes or the degradation of the landscape, remain unaddressed. Several actions are proposed that should be implemented by all actors involved in aquacultural management to improve social attitudes and, thus, the acceptance by the different segments of society.

In the first stage, the performance of fibre-reinforced self-compacting concrete was analysed in terms of main fresh and hardened properties. Nine different SCC mixtures were designed using three different ratios of Vf and Ar. The fresh tests were evaluated through the examination of the slump flow and T500 while the hardened tests include compressive and splitting tensile strength test. The optimal mixture was selected based on a statistical program (Minitab19) for the next stage. The optimized mix in stage two is selected to be a control mix in addition to other two mixtures with PET fibres treated chemically (NaOH solution), and mechanically (surface roughness). The fresh tests in this stage include slump flow, T500mm, L-box, sieve segregation whereas the hardened tests include compressive, splitting tensile, flexural, impact strength, porosity, and water absorption. The multi-objective optimization results from first stage indicated that the optimum Vf and Ar for PET fibres, to achieve the optimum performance in terms of the tested properties and the partitioning of sustainability aspects, were 0.7% and 24.4 respectively. The results of the two modifications used for PET fibres reduced the fresh properties slightly (flow, L-box, T500, sieve segregation) yet they were within the specification limits for SCC. However, the mechanical and related durability properties (strength, tensile, flexural, impact, less porosity, less absorption) were increased considerably. It can be deduced that treatment of PET fibres by increasing the roughness surface with the optimum characteristics of PET fibres from stage one, in terms Vf and Ar, can give the best performance. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","fresh properties; hardened properties; recycled PET fibres; Self-compacting concrete SCC","Aspect ratio; Compressive strength; Concrete mixtures; Fibers; Hardening; Impact strength; Mixtures; Multiobjective optimization; Plastic bottles; Polyethylene terephthalates; Porosity; Self compacting concrete; Sodium hydroxide; Surface roughness; Surface treatment; Tensile strength; Aspect-ratio; Fresh properties; Hardened properties; Performance of fibres; Pet fibres; Plastic fibers; Polyethylene terephthalates (PET); Recycled PET fiber; Self-compacting concrete SCC; Slump flow; Water absorption",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138258014

THM affects the organoleptic properties of water and, consequently, the produced beer. Water treatment based on common chemicals such as alum and free chlorine could potentially form THM. Therefore, we studied the replacement of chemicals used in water treatment: aluminum sulfate by a tannin-based coagulant and sodium hypochlorite by chlorine dioxide. Experimentally, jar tests were conducted, and the role of coagulants and oxidizing agents was evaluated for: the removal of apparent color, turbidity, natural organic matter (NOM) and microorganisms; the formation of trihalomethanes (THM); and the sensory quality of the water. Using tannin-based coagulant with chlorine dioxide was associated with the lowest THM in treated water (1.7 µg/L) and higher satisfaction in the sensory analysis. However, using these chemicals make the water treatment more expensive than the current strategy. Overall, using the tannin-based coagulant and chlorine dioxide treatment is an alternative to produce water with a lower THM concentration, better physical-chemical, and sensory quality.

Recognizing the un-sustainability of existing approaches in the production of these chemicals, the current study investigated the valorization of apple pomace (AP) for their production. The present study assessed AP valorization by imposing variations in processing conditions of temperature (100–260 °C), time (0.5–12 h), alcohol/water ratio v/v (0:1–1:0), and Fe3+/H2O2 molar ratio (10:1–100-1), in accordance to the Box-Behnken experimental design. The optimal yield of the oil was 24.6 wt.%, at the temperature, time, alcohol/water ratio v/v, and Fe3+/H2O2 molar ratio of 260 °C, 4.7 h, 1, and 100, respectively. Notably, the application of gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy showed that the oil product contained mainly aromatics and interestingly also alkanes, indicating that the experimental conditions imposed promoted secondary hydrogenation reactions of oxygen-containing species during AP valorization. A consideration of the comparative economics of the proposed AP valorization and the existing AP management approach, using approximate estimation techniques, highlighted the potential of a ~ 59% reduction in the unit cost of AP management. The study therefore presents a compelling basis for future investigations into AP waste management using the thermochemical liquefaction technology.

Furthermore, the research identifies how the practice of ESG reporting affects many variables such as financial performance, social performance, environmental performance, and sustainability score. The findings also indicate that the field of ESG is still evolving, with numerous unexplored themes.

It seeks to evaluate the relative contribution of blockchain technology to evaluate various measures in this study. A general research agenda for investigating blockchain capabilities to performance assessment in CE is presented. Design/methodology/approach: Empirical survey data from 32 CE and blockchain experts are collected to inform this study. Inductive reasoning, heatmaps, and a middle-range theory building approach are utilized to generalize theoretical patterns for blockchain support of CE performance assessment and measurement. A series of propositions are then developed as a middle-range theory for the true, false, perceptible, and hidden affordances of blockchain technology capabilities for CE performance measurement. Findings: Overall, sixteen performance measures and metrics are identified and examined. The authors find most of these measures and metrics – based on literature and expert opinion – can be supported using blockchain technology capabilities. Four major blockchain capabilities, transparency and traceability, reliability and security, smart contracts, and incentivization and tokenization are shown to have varying potential support for CE performance assessment. There needs to be an evaluation of true, false, perceptible, and hidden affordances of blockchain technology capabilities for CE performance measurement in future studies. Originality/value: Blockchain application for CE, and specifically performance measurements, is a new area. Research and practice evaluation on this issue is important but needs substantially additional investigation to help CE progress. This study provides a framework for evaluation and a foundation for future research at the nexus of CE, blockchain technology, and performance measurement. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Blockchain technology; Circular economy; Performance measurement; Supply chain; Sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138249470

As the ‘driving force of the transition’ citizens are expected a play a key role in achieving this shift, by adopting sustainable consumption habits and changing their life styles and behaviour as well as actively participating in policymaking [EC, 2019, 22]. This expectation raises questions about European citizenship: Can European citizenship be ‘greened’? Conversely, might the EGD strengthen European citizenship? Drawing together theoretical insights into ‘green citizenship’ with research on European citizenship this paper considers what a ‘green European citizenship’ (GEC) might look like. It examines the rights, duties, virtues and practices of a GEC, and underlines in particular the important role of ‘critical acts’ of European citizens. It concludes that while the initiatives of the EGD might provoke citizenship engagement, participation and identification, these initiatives might also further expose the fault lines between citizens in Europe. This possibility makes the critical acts undertaken by citizens all the more important. © 2022 The Author(s).

Specifically, the current study investigates Millennial and Generation Z travelers’ consumption intention for peer-to-peer accommodations—one of the most popular sharing economy business models. This study explores how consumption values impact young travelers’ choice of peer-to-peer accommodation and whether any similarities or differences exist across the two generational cohorts. The research findings suggest that, while utilitarian and hedonic values influence both young generations’ intention to use peer-to-peer accommodation, sustainability and social interaction values, as well as perceived social media exposure, play more important roles for Generation Z (vs. Millennials). Furthermore, young people’s needs for self-enhancement extends significant impacts on their value evaluations of the peer-to-peer accommodations, particularly for Millennials. These generational differences help industry practitioners better serve and market to the two market segments. © The Author(s) 2022.","consumer socialization; Generation Z; Millennials; peer-to-peer accommodation; service innovation; sharing economy",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138242538

The FPCs, which have been brought in for improved transparency and access to the input and output market with higher negotiating powers leading to sustainability of the small and marginal farmers, are said to provide higher legitimacy and credibility in the immediate business environment. Though Assam too is not behind in forming FPCs, challenges and issues abound. Majority of these FPCs are in the nascent stage of their operations with shareholder membership ranging from more than 500 farmers to over 1500 farmers. It is also seen that from capacity building to taking up business operations, many issues need to be addressed in these FPCs. These FPCs are in need of support in technical handholding and provision of adequate capital and infrastructure facilities including market linkages for sustaining their business operations. The present paper tries exploring and understanding the ecosystem of the FPCs in Assam, which are focussing on small and marginal farmers, and delving into the issues and challenges faced by the FPCs in the state and the possible ways out.

Researchers have found bamboo to be a potential replacement for steel as far as mechanical properties of concrete reinforcement are concerned. However, this composite’s durability characterization remains one of the major hindrances to its extensive application as steel replacement. This study investigates bamboo-reinforced concrete (BRC) durability to adverse working conditions such as high-temperature, acidic, and saline environments. Grade M25 concrete was used for the 150 × 150 × 550 mm BRC and steel-reinforced concrete (SRC) rectangular prisms. Flexural strength (fs) and weight loss of the concretes were assessed after 60-day curing period, having exposed BRC samples to adverse working conditions. The high-temperature test results indicated a lower slope of strength loss for BRC samples compared with the SRC, and a strength loss of 0.407 N/mm2 for BRC and 5.5 N/mm2 for SRC was obtained. The acid and chloride attack tests indicated a slower weight loss and strength loss for BRC samples. The weight loss for SRC and BRC beams was 0.95 kg and 0.54 kg for acid attack and 0.893 kg and 0.087 kg for chloride attack, respectively. In general, the BRC showed some promising characteristics, even under adverse working conditions than SRC. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Shiraz University.","Acid attack; Bamboo-reinforced concrete beams; Chloride attack; Concrete; Durability; Elevated temperature; Steel-reinforced concrete",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138238910

They host high climate mitigation potential and acute climate adaptation vulnerabilities. Scholarship flags conventional urban planning approaches to limit global warming to 1.5°C as inadequate. Yet urban sustainability transitions literature features few examples of functioning alternative governance and planning paradigms. This paper assesses one such approach, new municipalism: social movements centred on a democratic transformation of the local economy and state. We combine attention to urban sustainability transitions and new municipalism research to interrogate whether and how the latter can facilitate the provision of leadership and institutional arrangements that enable urban transformation to sustainability. Our desk study considers two prominent examples of new municipalism in Spain, where Barcelona en Comú and Ahora Madrid arose as anti-austerity movements to combat neoliberal urban agendas during the 2010s. We find that the praxis of collective decision-making associated with new municipalism does offer inclusive, innovative policy pathways and the potential to implement experimental knowledge and learning in complex real-world settings at the urban scale. We argue, however, that powerful neoliberal mechanisms impose structural constraints on the very push for deep political change that new municipalist movements embody. By linking transformative climate governance needs with new municipalism movements and wider political economic structuring forces, we explicate the tensions and contested dynamics of institutionalising progressive social movements in the multi-scalar governance of urban sustainability transformation. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2022.","incumbency; new municipalism; participation; policy alignment; urban sustainability transformation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138238263

Design/methodology/approach: The sample consists of 897 annual observations from 238 firms from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru for 2018–2020. The data were collected from the Refinitiv database. The proposed model and hypotheses were tested using the feasible generalized least squares estimation technique with heteroscedasticity and panel-specific AR1 autocorrelation. Findings: The results reveal that the presence of CSR committees positively influences the SDGs. Gender diversity positively moderates the relationship between CSR committees and SDGs. Leverage and firm size also positively impact the SDGs. On the other hand, board size and CEO duality negatively affect SDGs disclosure. Research limitations/implications: This study extends the scope of stakeholder theory by suggesting that CSR committees and gender diversity enable a better relationship for the firm with its stakeholders. Practical implications: The findings support policymakers and managers in improving sustainability disclosure. In addition, the results demonstrate the importance of CSR committees and gender diversity to meet the stakeholders' demands. Social implications: This study demonstrates how firms can improve sustainability issues through gender diversity and CSR committees.

The primary aim of our review is to systematically identify and critically review the literature on sustainable innovation in H&T amid COVID-19 (conducted in 2020 and 2021), in order to synthesize and classify prevalent types, antecedents, and outcomes of sustainable innovation. The authors present a comprehensive review of the 58 articles on sustainable innovation in H&T through the Web of Science (WoS) database, spanning over 2 years (2020–2021). This review demonstrates that since the beginning of COVID-19, H&T have strongly mobilized network technologies (especially social media and digital platforms) and data-processing technologies (especially Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)) in comparison with physical-digital interface technologies (especially Virtual Reality (VR)), while physical-digital process technologies remain very limited in these industries. Several relevant antecedents of the adoption of sustainable innovation, more specifically digital technologies, have been identified at multiple levels of analysis, including the organizational, managerial, and stakeholder levels. Our research also reveals several consequences of the adoption of sustainable innovation in H&T. These consequences were congregated according to the three main dimensions related to sustainability in economic, social, and environmental outcomes. This study provides important practical implications for the H&T sectors in the digital era and post-pandemic.

Objective: The purposes of our study were to determine the impact of the 2009 intervention on hospital-wide prescribing practices of vitamin therapies for alcohol-related illnesses, and to evaluate its long-term sustainability. Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted at a 60,000-visit ED, 811-bed academically-affiliated tertiary referral hospital with an average census of 515 and 714 patients in 2009 and 2019, respectively. Patients were included if they presented to the ED from 2009 to 2019 with an alcohol-related illness as defined by ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. The primary outcome was the change in the monthly average of MVIs ordered inpatient within the first four months compared to the last four months of the study period. Secondary outcomes included changes in the mean distribution (MD) per month of thiamine administrations in the ED and inpatient setting, and MVIs ordered in the ED. Results: The MD of MVIs ordered per month decreased by 3.5% (95% CI −5.3, −1.7) in the inpatient setting and decreased by 1.4% (95% CI −2.5, −.3) in the ED from the beginning to the end of our study period. Conclusions: This study suggests the effects of an intervention made in the ED sustained impact over a 10-year timeframe, and decreased the use of MVIs in both the ED and hospital-wide. © The Author(s) 2022.","emergency department; multivitamin; therapeutic momentum; thiamine",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138234550

Design/methodology/approach: The research questions are examined across three studies. Consumer’s scepticism of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is considered the driver of brand distance. Brand hypocrisy is postulated to mediate the relationship between scepticism to CSR and brand distance. Furthermore, brand trust and desire for exclusivity are tested as moderators of brand hypocrisy and brand distance. Findings: The findings showed that environmental misconduct leads to perceived brand hypocrisy and brand distancing. When luxury brands take action to remedy their actions, the perceived brand hypocrisy and brand distancing decrease. In addition, brand trust and desire for exclusivity dilute the relationship between brand hypocrisy and brand distance. Originality/value: The findings show that, standing in a contradictory position, brands can still reduce the consumers’ perceived brand distance by building a strong consumers’ trust toward the brand. At the same time, relating the luxury consumers’ yearning for the exclusive products and services, the findings show that the consumers with a strong desire for exclusivity feel a lower level of brand distance even if the brand gets involved in misconduct. © 2022, Isaac Cheah, Anwar Sadat Shimul and Min Teah.","Brand communication; Brand distance; Brand hypocrisy; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Luxury brand; Sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138231882

Aim: The aim of this study was to explore how occupational therapists experienced continuous quality improvement work based on the Occupational Therapy Intervention Process Model after 17 years. Method: Two focus group interviews were conducted with a total of 12 occupational therapists. The data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: The analysis resulted in three themes with related subthemes describing the occupational therapists’ experiences of their model-based long-term improvement work. The themes were labelled as follows: ‘sharing a safe and well-known professional reasoning’, ‘reaching normality and empowerment’ and ‘questioning and reshaping the too safe and too well-known normality’. The model functioned as a sustainable framework both for ordinary clinical practice and for continuous improvement work. Conclusion: By using the model, the occupational therapists had established a safe and well-known professional reasoning in which continual quality improvement work had become sustainable. © 2022 Scandinavian Journal of Occupational Therapy Foundation.","Models of practice; occupational therapy; professional reasoning; sustainability","article; clinical practice; content analysis; empowerment; human; interview; occupational therapist; occupational therapy; process model; reasoning; total quality management",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138224719

A few other studies in the Global North suggest that greening initiatives might be disproportionately located in disadvantaged neighbourhoods that are gentrifying as opposed to disadvantaged areas experiencing continuous disinvestment. Building on these findings, in this critical commentary we present the green gentrification cycle, which sheds light on the complex spatiotemporal relationships between greening and gentrification. The cycle posits that gentrification can precede greening, gentrification can follow greening and, in some cases, gentrification can both precede and then follow greening. We present the actors and processes involved in intentionally steering greening to already gentrifying communities and discuss them through an environmental justice lens. Specifically, we propose three complementary explanations for why gentrification precedes greening, including demand from gentrifiers, push from the green growth machine and increased resource availability in gentrifying communities. We then present a research agenda on the green gentrification cycle, including the need for a better understanding of how the cycle might materialise in places with varying political economies, such as the Global South. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2022.","environmental gentrification; environmental justice; parks; urban greening; urban sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138223323

Qualitative data revealed three motivations for joining ShareCare: instrumental, social, and altruistic. Long-term membership was operationalized as 8 years or more. Logistic regression models indicated that people with altruistic motivation were more likely to be long-term members compared to members without altruistic motivation.

In modern world, evaluation of an appropriate solid waste disposal method (SWDM) can be referred as multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem due to involvement of several conflicting quantitative and qualitative sustainability indicators. The imprecision and ambiguity are usually arisen in SWDM assessment problem, and the q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS) has been recognized as one of the adaptable and valuable ways to tackle the complex uncertain information arisen in realistic problems. In the context of q-ROFSs, entropy is a significant measure for depicting fuzziness and uncertain information of q-ROFS and the discrimination measure is generally used to quantify the distance between two q-ROFSs by evaluating the amount of their discrimination. Thus, the aim of this study is to propose a novel integrated framework based on multi-attribute multi-objective optimization with the ratio analysis (MULTIMOORA) method with q-rung orthopair fuzzy information (q-ROFI). In this approach, an integrated weighting process is presented by combining objective and subjective weights of criteria with q-ROFI. Inspired by the q-rung orthopair fuzzy entropy and discrimination measure, objective weights of criteria are estimated by entropy and discrimination measure-based model. Whereas, the subjective weights are derived based on aggregation operator and the score function under q-ROFS environment. In this respect, novel entropy and discrimination measure are proposed for q-ROFSs. Furthermore, to display the feasibility and usefulness of the introduced approach, a case study related to SWD method selection is presented under q-ROFS perspective. Finally, comparison and sensitivity investigation are presented to confirm the robustness and solidity of the introduced approach. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Discrimination measure; Entropy; MCDM; q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets; Solid waste disposal method",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138222584

Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is an important and often traditional livelihood in the rural global south where income generating alternatives are scarce. Marmato is one of South America's oldest gold mining sites, and ASM has been intermittently practiced there since about 500 B.C. The present study maps ASM onto the five capitals of the SLF and identifies several forms of capitals that miners cited as the most relevant for pursuing ASM activities. The results show that artisanal and small-scale gold miners in Marmato strategically combine different forms of capital that enable them to make a living from mining; however, there are key factors that may impact the longer-term viability of artisanal and small-scale mining livelihoods. Although human, social, and financial capital function to support ASM livelihoods, the finite nature of natural capital and deterioration of physical capital erode the potential for sustainability of those livelihoods. This research highlights the utility of closely examining the capitals in the SLF and suggests that a more comprehensive understanding of ASM capitals can better inform formalization policies and associated development interventions. © 2022","Artisanal and small-scale mining; Colombia; Formalization; Social capital; Sustainable livelihoods framework",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138219501

Four internal (quality of information technology [QIT], market orientation, business strategy and structure of accounting department) and two external (environmental uncertainty and market competition) governance mechanisms were examined. Design/methodology/approach: The population of the study is comprised of 56 publicly listed manufacturing companies on the Mainboard of the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Data were collected using a questionnaire which was completed by senior finance personnel in each company in the sample. Structural equation modelling, logistic regression and quantile regression analysis were used to analyse data. Findings: The results show that the extent to which Nigerian companies have implemented SAP is moderate. The authors find that the level of SAP implementation is significantly associated with market orientation and business strategy, but not with the QIT and structure of accounting department. The results also show that both external corporate governance mechanisms (i.e. environmental uncertainty and intensity of competition) have no significant effect on SAP. Practical implications: The insignificant influence of external corporate governance mechanisms on SAP corroborates the contention that external pressure on companies to implement sustainability initiatives in developing countries is weak.

This study monetizes the increasing costs of orbital debris and costs of space preservation through Monte Carlo simulations using a break-even analysis. Orbital debris imposes satellite fortification, avoidance, and early replacement costs on satellite owners. This paper assigns values to NASA published space debris mitigation models for an estimate of space preservation costs. Estimating space debris costs has been hampered by a lack of information largely due to commercial proprietary information. This study shows how simple-realistic assumptions can turn sparse data into the basis of a robust analysis. Further, by conducting a break-even analysis of these cost streams, this study identifies the global cost savings after the costs of space debris equals the costs of space preservation. Using alternative inputs, this study conducts sensitivity analyses to identify the effectiveness of mitigation and remediation options. At a 90% success rate of post-mission disposal (PMD) and an active removal of as few as 5 defunct spacecraft per year are the sufficient and effective space preservation measures if spacefaring communities are in compliance with them sooner rather than later. Phases and timelines for global practicing measures of mitigation and remediation are sensitive to the outcome of break-even analysis. In conclusion, spacefaring communities need to stabilize the space debris environment for cost-savings and space sustainability. A simple solution is post-mission disposal and a worldwide orbital user sinking fund per launch to finance future debris removal and hedge preservation timeline uncertainty.active debris removal missions per year that proposed by NASA ODPO would cost less than one third the costs of space debris under the status quo. © 2022","Active debris removal; ADR; BEP 25 year rule; Cost of orbital debris; Economics; Externality; Forecast; Orbital debris mitigation; Pigouvian taxes and space economy; PMD; Post-mission disposal; Remediation; Simulation; Sinking fund; Space awareness cost; Spill-over; Statistics; Uncertainty",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138212090

The primary objective of this study is to find out the impact of hydropower factors and economic growth on the agriculture industry output among the EU27 nations within the time factor 1990 to 2021. Adopting the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL), the findings show a significant positive effect could occur in agriculture industry growth of the European Union (EU13)-emerging economies using hydropower factors than in EU14-emerged economies. On one hand, among additional factors, economic growth and institutional quality contribute more positively to agriculture growth in EU13 economies than in EU14 economies. On the other hand, population density contributes more negatively to agriculture growth in EU13 economies than in EU14 economies. The findings show there can be a positive significant growth increase in the EU13 agriculture industry using fossil fuel output than in EU14 economies. The results show that growth could be sustained in the agricultural industry of the European nations by increasing the level of hydropower production as this will help in attaining sustainable development by the year 2030. This will therefore help in mitigating the effect of climatic changes due to environmental pollution. The projected calculations were seen to be reliable and valid and this was attested to by the three estimators used in the study (pooled mean group, mean group, and dynamic fixed effect). This study recommended that European nations could leverage hydroelectricity to achieve sustainable growth and development. The legislative arms of the government of these European nations should as well show more interest in green energy to achieve security and sustainable development in hydroelectricity production. Decision-makers in the EU nations should buttress more emphasis on sustainable means through which hydropower could be used to attain sustainable irrigation systems for the agriculture industry and thus minimize the demand for fossil fuels and reduce CO2-related emissions in the future tine ahead. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Agriculture; Economic growth; Fossil fuel; Hydro-electricity; Sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138210750

Further, stringent environmental norms and growing environmental awareness has pushed industrial sectors to adopt sustainable industrial practice. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), an industrial performance assessment tool, has several limitations and hence, it is difficult to measure the performance of industrial sectors in terms of sustainability. The present study aims to identify and evaluate the challenges to LCA. Methods: Combining literature review and industrial interactions has identified 20 challenges to LCA under five-category comparability, data, resource requirements, organizational structure, and uncertainty communication. An integrated Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique comprising of Best-Worst Method (BWM) and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation of Laboratory (DEMATEL) is used to evaluate the challenges to LCA. BWM is used to prioritize the challenges to LCA, and DEMATEL is used to reveal interrelationships among the challenges. Results: Outcomes of BWM indicates problems with the quality of data, lack of inventory data, difficulty in comparison, absence of dedicated LCA method, and scale-up issues as the top five critical challenges to LCA adoption. According to DEMATEL result, seven challenges come under cause category and the remaining 13 challenges come under effect category. Conclusions: Challenges to LCA have been evaluated using an integrated approach comprising of BWM-DEMATEL. Outcome of the integrated approach helps in prioritizing the challenges and also in exposing the interrelationships among the challenges. The study's outcome would assist industrial management and practitioners in identifying the critical challenges to LCA.

The study applies the binary probit and the instrumental variable probit regressions to analyse the data from the Indian Stock Exchange. Findings: The authors find that female chief executive officers (CEOs) are more likely to choose stand-alone reports over integrated reporting. The authors also find that female CEOs with a duality role are insignificant in choosing between integrated reporting and stand-alone sustainability reporting. Furthermore, the study shows that gender board diversity (percentage of women over total board size) and females of two or less are insignificant. However, three or more females on the board significantly and positively affect stand-alone sustainability reporting. Similarly, independent female directors are more likely to choose stand-alone reporting over integrated reporting.

But nowadays the demand of modern population has made engineers to force towards the planning of groundwater quality with proper treatment. But due to increase in urbanization, the ground water becomes more polluted and contaminated with micro-organisms and other harmful organic matter. In portions of Ludhiana, India, groundwater is a major supply of drinking and irrigation water. The groundwater is under threat as a result of population development and extensive irrigation methods; accessible groundwater is being depleted, and its quality is deteriorating. As a result, a total of 9 groundwater samples were taken from various regions of Ludhiana Punjab in order to assess its suitability for drinking and irrigation. The contaminated groundwater was tested for various physico chemical parameters like pH, TA, TH, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), calcium, magnesium, sulphate, chloride, nitrate and fluoride. The findings of the research will be beneficial for the development of an effective strategy to utilize the groundwater for diverse agricultural applications.

It has great importance for almost all Asian countries. Its success is expected to dictate the economic development of the stakeholders. The aim of this study is to evaluate the essential determinants deriving the sustainability of CPEC projects. The design of the study comprises of the review of literature, data collection, and analysis. Population under study is the folk of stakeholders of CPEC. Sampling envisages on purposive sampling design, i.e., 14 experts from within the stakeholders. Primary data is collected in the field setting through a survey questionnaire appropriate for the study. ISM is used for modelling and MICMAC for analysis and classification using inductive approach. The findings of the literature survey show that there are 23 prime determinants of sustainability of CPEC projects. The results of ISM show that 13 determinants are at Level-I, nine at Level-II, and one determinant namely “economic globalization” is at Level-III being the most critical and driving determinant. The findings of MICMAC show that only one determinant is classified in independent quadrant, and all the remaining determinants are in linkage quadrant, whereas, no determinant is shown in autonomous and/or dependence quadrant. But most of the determinants have potential to be classified in dependent and independent quadrants. It is intimately evident that the results of MICMAC corroborate the results of ISM. It is useful for folk of the stakeholders by way of developing an understanding about the multitude of determinants, intra-determinant relations, prioritizing the determinants for policy decisions, and/or for building future studies.

This paper aims to show how the context of the pandemic, which demanded the transition from in-person classes to virtual classes, was used to illustrate better the concepts of life cycle assessment (LCA) for Production Engineering students in a Brazilian University. Design/methodology/approach: The research strategy used was action research. Throughout the discipline offering, the environmental impacts resulting from in-person and remote classes were comparatively assessed through a practical activity using LCA. Students’ behaviour and perception of the activities were recorded by the professor and discussed with the other researchers on the team. At the end of the course, students answered a questionnaire to assess their satisfaction with different aspects of the discipline, and these data were analysed via Fuzzy Delphi. Findings: The results focus on discussing the pedagogical aspects of this experience and not the environmental impacts resulting from each class modality. It was possible to notice a greater engagement of students when using a project that directly involved their daily activities (food, transportation, use of electronics, etc.) compared to the traditional approach of teaching LCA concepts. In this traditional approach, the examples focussed on the industrial sector, a more distant context from the reality of most students. Student feedback demonstrated great acceptance by them regarding the approach adopted.

This demand has an impact on the high chemical fertilizer consumption. Simultaneously, another problem arises owing to unsustainable agricultural practices, namely low fertilizer efficiency. Controlled/slow-release (CRF/SRF) fertilizers using cellulose biopolymers as composite matrices are a sustainable prospect owing to their being abundant, renewable, and biodegradable. Furthermore, cellulose contains surface chemical properties that are easily modified to play a role in the fertilizers’ release. In addition, the high cellulose hydrophilicity helps maintain soil moisture for plant growth. This article reviews the prospects of cellulose and its derivatives for CRF/SRF development, including cellulose modification, slow/controlled-release mechanisms, and their impact on sustainable agricultural practices, which are discussed based on environmental, economic and social aspects.

The fabricated bare SnO2, SnO2@CeO2, and Li-SnO2@CeO2 nanostructures were investigated by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-VIS), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The heterostructure preparation of the SnO2@CeO2 sample was verified by XRD and FT-IR analyses. The XRD results showed the tetragonal and cubic phases related to the SnO2 and CeO2, respectively. The suppression in bandgap from 2.51 eV to 2.22 eV on Li was estimated from Tauc plots obtained from the UV-VIS curve. Also, the Li-SnO2@CeO2 nanocomposite, when utilized as a catalyst for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) during light irradiation, demonstrates a superior photodegradation performance of 92%, which is higher than all other fabricated catalysts. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.","nanoparticles; photocatalyst activity; Rhodamine B dye; tin oxide; visible light",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138176997

This paper also presents a case for closer focus on developing Education for Sustainability (EfS) leaders in institutions of higher learning. Design/methodology/approach: This study is a quantitative comparative research. The authors collected data for EfS-related variables from lecturers affiliated with Malaysian and Japanese public and private universities. Building on the data and results from the TLSHE study, this study made a series of within- and between-sample descriptive comparisons from different angles and levels. To generalize the findings, this study used gender and experience outside higher education as control variables and compared the academics from the Malaysian and the Japanese institutions through the path modeling framework. Findings: The comparisons showed that except for two domains, namely, contextual factors influencing EfS leadership and the EfS leadership development approaches, the means of all other domains based on the data collected from the Malaysian sample were the highest, followed by means from the international TLSHE sample, and finally the means from the Japanese sample. This study also observed that transparency, engagement with EfS initiatives at different levels, passion for teaching and learning, and creative and lateral thinking were among the top indicators. The inferential tests revealed significant differences between the academics from Japan and Malaysia as well. Practical implications: The findings of the analyses can be used to ensure that the selection and development of EfS leaders (in this case, lecturers who may be formal or informal EfS leaders), not just at the central but at the local level in the distinctive context of Japan and Malaysia, focus on what counts and the good ideas embodied in the 17 UN SDGs are actually put into practice. This study has also highlighted the policy implications with respect to the gender and the previous work experience of lecturers outside higher education sector in more detail. Originality/value: This study compares the perceptions of two samples of academics from Asian countries with the perceptions of the international TLSHE sampled EfS leaders in terms of EfS leadership-related issues and therefore, increases the awareness of academic community in this regard. It also highlights the role of lecturers (e.g. professors) as intellectual academic leaders in achieving SDGs. Moreover, this study shows that lecturers’ gender and previous work experience outside higher education should be considered when developing and implementing policies on EfS leadership. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic leadership capability framework; Education for Sustainability (EfS) leadership; Japan; Malaysia; Turnaround Leadership for Sustainability in Higher Education (TLSHE)",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138172895

Accordingly, conducting a comprehensive analysis of the main parameters affecting this issue using appropriate tools and techniques to optimally select projects in uncertain situations is of great significance. Moreover, these approaches should be aligned with sustainability concepts as a necessity in modern society and include interactions among society, including social interactions, development, and the environment to meet today's needs. Therefore, the present study aimed to provide a comprehensive two-objective sustainable model. This model collected the maximum efficiency of the selected portfolio by making changes in the data envelopment analysis in terms of network interdependency between projects and the potential impact of projects on each other. The direct and indirect connections concluded by interdependency between projects were also determined by a Bayesian network modeling to analyze the criticality and possible impact of a project's failure on each other and on the entire portfolio. Moreover, the proposed comprehensive model provided that the maximum use of organizational resources whit the minimums of organizational goals.

Energy awareness is a feasible energy conservation measure, but an inappropriate approach can cause the wastage of resources. The current number of reported awareness studies especially among the university student is quite limited, and focus is more given to the awareness on renewable energy, instead of energy conservation. Design/methodology/approach: A paper-based survey using a set of questionnaires that involved 2,857 respondents. There are four sections in this questionnaire, which are basic background information of respondents, knowledge (yes/true or no/false choice of responses), attitude (a scale of 1–10, where 10 indicates “strongly agree” and 1 chooses “strongly disagree”) and practices (a scale of 1–10, where 10 indicates “Always” and 1 selects “Never”). The evaluation includes the correlation analysis of all awareness variables with an educational background to disclose the most critical aspects that should be highly considered in the forthcoming awareness campaign. Findings: This research revealed that university students have a high level of awareness of energy conservation. They hold a high knowledge level and show a positive attitude with very good energy conservation practices. However, some issues require serious attention in preparing energy management plans. Effective approaches should be taken by considering the field of study, gender and family economic status to enhance the awareness level of the university students on energy conservation. Originality/value: The absence of appropriate references complicates the preparation of energy management plans including the establishment of energy policy and strategies. The findings of this research can contribute some contextual information in the local perspective to ensure the effectiveness of the energy management program and strengthen academic leadership by emphasising the element of sustainability. This is crucial for developing an energy saving culture among the young generation that will be our future scholars and leaders. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Awareness; Energy conservation; Field of study; Questionnaire; University student",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138169310

Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional online survey was used to collect quantitative data on sustainability knowledge, behaviors and attitudes among 291 undergraduate college students at a mid-size Midwestern US university. This study used a structural equation model to answer the research questions. Findings: In all, 291 students completed a sustainability attitudes and behaviors survey. The results of this study show sustainability knowledge is poor (average score 5.3/10). Statistical modeling indicates positive influence of economic attitudes on sustainable behaviors; however, ecology and social attitudes were not associated with sustainable behaviors. Furthermore, those with greater sustainable knowledge engaged in fewer sustainable behaviors. Practical implications: Sustainability and/or wellness initiatives can provide education targeting actionable behaviors college students can make to reduce their carbon footprint, including washing clothes in cold water, limiting red meat consumption, recycling, reducing food waste and taking shorter showers. Sustainability initiatives such as organizing a recycling competition and coordinating volunteers for local clean-up days and events such as Earth Day celebrations offer opportunities for collaboration between campus departments and engagement and socialization among students, staff and faculty. The inclusion of sustainability in college curricula may increase students’ knowledge, develop critical thinking skills and self-efficacy related to sustainability and promote climate action. Originality/value: First, this study adds to the literature in terms of the use of structural equation modeling. Second, this study’s results indicate a dissociation between positive sustainable attitudes as they relate to sustainable behaviors. Why is it that students think the environment is important yet do not place importance on sustainable behaviors? These issues are highly relevant and present opportunities for future research and interventions aimed at increasing sustainable behaviors. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","College students; Eco-friendly; Environmental education; Environmentally friendly; Sustainability education",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138167317

Among renewable energy sources, offshore wind energy has been considerably growing since longer and larger wind turbine composite blades were deployed. The manufacture of the longer and larger composite blades leads to more wind energy production. However, the wind turbine composite blades are susceptible to damage and defects due to multiple structural loads and harsh operating environments in service. Hence, condition monitoring and maintenance of wind turbine composite blades require in-depth investigation to prevent structural damage and defects and to improve remaining lifetime of the composite structure. The types of damage and defects in wind turbine composite blades are typically delamination, debonding, and cracks, which are influenced by the intrinsic structural nonlinearities, manufacturing process stage, and harsh environmental impacts in service. For these reasons, the regular condition monitoring of the composite blades is required to assess degradation in performance and structural condition to minimise levelised energy costs for maintenance. To improve reliability and sustainability, data-driven inspection with digital twin technology is reviewed as a trend of condition monitoring frameworks. Advanced functional materials to potentially assist current non-destructive testing (NDT) methods or to be utilised as self-sensing performance are reviewed. From manufacturing to the system level, a comprehensive review on progress and trends of monitoring of wind turbine composite blades is carried out including physics-based NDT methods, data fusion in sensor networks, automated system, mechanics, and digital twin technology with the environmental coupling. © 2022 The Authors","Condition monitoring; Digital twin; Maintenance; Non-destructive testing; Wind turbine blades",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138164895

The carbon market is recognized as the most promising mean to curb carbon emissions, furthermore, carbon price forecasting will promote the role of the carbon market in emissions reduction and achieve reduction targets at lower economic costs for emission entities. However, there are still some technical problems in carbon price prediction, such as mode mixing and larger reconstruction error for the traditional empirical mode decomposition-type models. Therefore, the innovation of this paper is constructing a novel carbon price prediction model of complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN)-long short-term memory (LSTM), that combines the advantages of CEEMDAN in decomposing the multiscale time-frequency carbon price signals and the LSTM model in fitting the financial signals. The results show the proposed CEEMDAN-LSTM model has significant accuracy in predicting the complex carbon price signals. The prediction error and expectation indicators of root mean square error, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and direction accuracy are 0.638342, 0.448695, 0.015666, and 0.687631, respectively, which is better than other benchmark models. Further evidence convince that the short-term forecasting performance is superior to the long-term and medium-term performance. That evidence concludes that the proposed model is a reliable method to reveal the carbon price-driving mechanism from the point of multiscale time-frequency characteristics. Particularly, short-term forecasting is more accurate and can provide a valuable technical reference for reduction entities and green financial companies to judge the market situation and formulate quantitative transactions. © 2022 The Authors.

The sustainable and eco-friendly technologies have led to more sustainable methodologies, substantial stewardship of our natural resources, and the conversion to renewable energy sources, all of which have been demonstrated to benefit the environment significantly. However, prior studies have overlooked the ecological sustainability and energy transition effects of green technology innovation. Therefore, this study endeavored to investigate the role of green innovation (lnGRN) and financial globalization (lnFIG) on the sustainability of the environment (lnEFT) and energy transition (lnENT) in the United Kingdom using quarterly data for the period from 1995 to 2020. The study applied the time-varying (bootstrapping) rolling window technique, which can retrieve casual associations among variables at different periods of sub-samples. Besides this, the method is advantageous for addressing the non-consistency of parameters and eliminating the pre-test distortion. The novel Bootstrap Rolling-Window full-sample causality technique results demonstrate that lnGRN and lnFIG have unidirectional causality toward lnEFT and lnENT. Furthermore, the bootstrap rolling-window subsamples in the final stage indicate that lnGRN and lnFIG mitigate lnEFT, whereas lnGRN and lnGDP enhance energy transition. On the other hand, lnGDP and lnETX contribute to environmental deterioration, while lnFIG hinders the energy transition. Several important policy implications are derived from the results to encourage financial globalization, green innovation technologies, renewable energy resources consumption, and environmental taxes. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","bootstrap rolling-window causality; ecological footprint; energy transition; environmental tax; financial globalization; green innovation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138161907

Design/methodology/approach: Data from 167 human resources directors, hotel managers and other employees were analyzed by partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Findings: Results indicate a strong positive relationship between entrepreneurial resilience and entrepreneurial orientation. Entrepreneurial orientation significantly increased all eco-label strategies, but not all strategies enhanced sustainable tourism practices. High adoption of sustainability practices depended on core strategies related to awareness, benefits, reputation and necessity, but the cost was also an issue. Managers adopted sustainability practices if they were not perceived as costly, or when perceived as costly if they believed they would help them reduce operating costs. Practical implications: Policymakers should assist hotel managers when the sector is hit by political events, natural disasters or health crises such as the current pandemic can bounce back and develop their resilience. Likewise, training and workshops can be organized to improve managers’ entrepreneurial mindset, which was found to be a precursor to favorable attitudes toward sustainability.

The main objective of this study was to discover why, despite the formation of new residential areas, these settlements have been able to survive and maintain their original functions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used the concept of living heritage sites as an analytical framework. The field data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed through qualitative content analysis. Findings: This study revealed that the reasons for the survival of these settlements were cultural and social rather than physical. Four main factors play a role in the survival of these settlements: (1) solidarity and unity among the inhabitants, (2) built environment as an ancestral heritage and a symbol of identity, (3) comfort and convenience in ksour and (4) social control and adherence to tradition. However, some concerns have arisen in recent decades that may endanger the viability of these settlements in the future, requiring more attention from the government. Originality/value: While previous studies on urban heritage and World Heritage Sites (WHSs) have mainly focused on tourism development and conservation issues, this paper emphasized a less-studied aspect of these sites, i.e. continuity and sustainability.

Eco-social policies contribute both to providing a social floor or redistributing resources to where they are needed and to respecting an ecological ceiling by keeping human activities within ecological limits. We discuss five such policies and highlight arguments for and against defining them as eco-social policies: a maximum income, a wealth tax, a basic income, a working time reduction and a meat tax. Asking what the social and individual determinants of supporting these policies are, we use 2020 data from a representative survey in Sweden containing information about how respondents evaluate the policies. We run regression analyses to estimate the effects on these evaluations and test for socio-economic, knowledge-based and value-based factors. Results show that (1) in Sweden a working time reduction is the most supported eco-social policy; (2) political left orientation increases support for all five eco-social policies; (3) socio-economic factors have effects on wealth tax, maximum income and working time reduction; and (4) knowledge-based factors are more associated with the meat tax. Thus, socio-economic and knowledge-based models have the most significance for policies that could be understood as being either social or environmental, while value-based models have significance across potentially perceived policy divides and hence to a greater extent explain support for policies targeting an ecological ceiling and a social floor. © 2022, The Author(s).","Attitudes; Basic income; Eco-social policy; Maximum income; Sustainable welfare; Working time reduction",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138158056

The sluggish kinetics of water-splitting reactions, namely, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, remains a bottleneck to the water electrolysis technology. High-entropy materials, due to their compositional flexibility, structural stability, and synergy between various elemental components, have recently aroused considerable interest in catalyzing the water-splitting reactions. Herein, a timely review of the recent achievements is provided in high-entropy materials for water electrolysis. An overview of different kinds of high-entropy materials for catalyzing the HER and OER half-reactions is introduced, followed by a discussion of theoretical and experimental efforts in understanding the fundamental origins of the enhanced catalytic performance observed on high-entropy catalysts. Various materials design strategies, including control of size and shape, construction of a porous structure, engineering of defect, and formation of hybrid/composite structure, to develop high-entropy catalysts with improved catalytic performance are highlighted. Finally, the remaining challenges are pointed out and the corresponding perspectives to address these challenges are put forward to promote the development of the research field of high-entropy water-splitting catalysts. © 2022 The Authors.

Plant hormones are known to play critical role in regulating plant response to stress by up-regulating the proteins and antioxidant enzymes. The present study aimed at alleviation of salt stress in potato cv. Cardinal by exogenous application of various concentrations of indoleacetic acid (IAA; 17.142, 22.875 or 28.570 μM) and its precursor l-tryptophan (0, 1, 5, 10 or 15 μM) under in vitro conditions. Salt stress was imposed by four NaCl (0, 40, 60 or 80 mM) concentrations. Two modes of IAA application were tested, i.e., added directly to Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium or pretreatment of nodal explants procured from in vitro-raised potato plants. Tryptophan was added directly into the medium containing various concentrations of NaCl. Results were recorded for morphological (shoot and root length, number of shoots and roots and nodes and fresh weight) and biochemical parameters (protein content, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities) after 30 days of NaCl and IAA/tryptophan treatment. Salinity caused significant reduction in all growth parameters as well as in all biochemical attributes. Exogenously applied IAA and l-tryptophan alleviated these detrimental effects of salinity by enhancing potato growth, protein content and antioxidant enzyme activities in normal as well as NaCl-stressed plants. Direct incorporation of IAA into the medium was found to be a better approach as compared to its pretreatment to the nodal explants. This study has shown up-regulation of proteins, POD, and SOD activities by using IAA and l-tryptophan indicating their possible involvement in the scavenging process of reactive oxygen species in potato growing under salt stress. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Antioxidant enzymes; Indoleacetic acid; Potato; Proteins; Salt stress; Tryptophan",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138154185

Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) and a case study have been undertaken to explore the innovative ideas for a sustainable fashion supply chain developed after the COVID-19 outbreak. Having conducted a comprehensive literature search in electronic databases Google Scholar, Emerald Insight, ScienceDirect and ProQuest, 69 articles were selected and reviewed. A case of the Kering Group was used to explain the results. Findings: This paper highlighted the basic concepts of a sustainable supply chain, reviewed the 10 principles of the United Nation Global Compact and their connections to promoting supply chain sustainability, as well as the three components of a sustainable supply chain: green supply chain, transparent supply chain and circular supply chain. Based on the results of a SLR and a real case of Kering Group, the paper identified 12 innovative ideas for a sustainable fashion supply chain: (1) biodegradable and natural materials, (2) textile recycling, (3) nearshoring, (4) artificial intelligence (AI), (5) robot, (6) 3D printing, (7) Internet of Things, (8) blockchain, (9) reverse resources; (10) bio-packaging, (11) augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) and (12) digital runway. Research limitations/implications: The epidemiological situations of the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding innovative ideas for a sustainable supply chain may change over time. While this paper provides a comprehensive literature review and case study, further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of current efforts in the development of a sustainable fashion supply chain through collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. Practical implications: Embracing the issues from the COVID-19 pandemic, the results of this study are further explained by the case of Kering Group in the fashion industry. The managerial implications of the results and discussion are the need to adopt innovative ideas for a more sustainable fashion supply chain in the future. The success of sustainable supply chains work by leveraging the best available technologies such as robot, 3D printing, AR and VR, setting consistent standards for sustainability such as Environmental Profit and Loss and Kering & Textile Exchange and communicating with all parties throughout the supply chain, such as blockchain and AI. Investment in developing technology and innovative ideas will be the key of future to supply chain sustainability. Nonetheless, the specific approach used by each organization must be tailored to its characteristics, goals and circumstances. Social implications: Bringing upon unprecedented challenges, the pandemic has shown both companies and consumers just how fragile our planet is. Thus, to protect our planet in the long run, we need to not only make businesses more sustainable but also live more eco-friendly lifestyles. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work that conducts a systemic review of the relevant academic journal articles addressed to the managerial audience on sustainable (fashion) supply chain.

Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews are conducted with 16 owners and heirs of UAE family businesses. The interviews – face-to-face and asynchronous electronic – are conducted instead of a questionnaire to get an in-depth analysis of the topic in the context of both medium- and large-sized family businesses. Findings: The responses are mixed with regard to governance challenges (duality, gender, internal control, transparency, etc.). The majority of the interviewees indicate that succession planning remains one of the biggest challenges for family businesses in the UAE. Fifteen of the sixteen interviewees document that a sound succession strategy must be in place to ensure the continuity of the business and prevent future disputes among potential successors. Similarly, the respondents also emphasise the importance of transparency and accountability for the sustainability of family businesses. The sustainability of family businesses relies on many aspects, such as national regulations, corporate systems and the succession process. Finally, most of the respondents from medium-sized companies opined that incorporating CG is a time-consuming and expensive process. Practical implications: The interviewees supported stewardship theory in case family members are occupying positions on the board as they have more long-term commitment and a greater sense of belonging to the business (socio-emotional wealth) compared to non-family members. The interviewees acknowledge that the lack of professionalism and conflicts of interest among family members can be offset by recruiting non-family members. Originality/value: Family businesses are particularly significant in the Arab world as they account for over 60% of gross domestic product (GDP) and use above 80% of the workforce which make them interesting research subject. In addition, this paper explores the CG challenges faced by both large- and medium-sized family businesses in the UAE within the theoretical framework of stewardship theory. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Challenges; Corporate governance; Family business; Family governance; Large- and medium-sized business; Semi-structured interview; Stewardship Theory; United Arab Emirates",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138146433

However, studies that provide evidence-based and practical recommendations on how to better regulate the TCM trade for sustainability and biodiversity conservation remain limited. China is the biggest promotor of and market for TCM and understanding the TCM trade in China is important for global biodiversity conservation. In particular, conservation researchers need to better understand how the TCM trade and its regulations interact with China's development needs and should collaborate with TCM communities to propose locally adapted suggestions to decision makers. However, progress in these areas has been restricted by language, cultural, and knowledge barriers. In this paper, we provide an overview of the current status of TCM-related regulations in China, identify weaknesses in regulation frameworks, and highlight issues that currently limit our understanding of the magnitude, dynamics, and impact of the trade. We propose changes in trade regulations, actions to enhance law enforcement, and future research directions to encourage a more sustainable TCM trade that benefits both global biodiversity conservation and TCM development. © 2022 The Authors.

However, the construction industry itself has negative impacts on the environment, society, and the economy. Therefore, during the construction phase, the contractors who are responsible for delivering construction projects should have a suitably adaptable sustainability solution. Qualified and experienced contractors are, of course, vital for the success of construction projects, and measuring their performance with respect to sustainability during the construction phase is crucial. However, there is currently very little evidence of a comprehensive and integrated assessment approach. This research aims to properly devise a smoother development process and improve potential deliverables for the construction industry in Jordan. A list of sustainability assessment indicators was developed for use during the construction phase, to assess the performance of the contractors, using a review of the literature, surveys, and by drawing upon expert opinion. As a result, 78 indicators have been formulated, across the five major dimensions of environmental, social, economic, lean manufacturing, and cultural, all of which influence contractor performance regarding sustainability practices. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Construction industry; Contractor’s performance; Jordan; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability indicators",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138139628

For this reason, a systematic procedure is proposed to evaluate the synergies of the water–energy–food nexus in a large region that is divided into subregions that allow considering their interactions. The new procedure considers the availability, accessibility and regional interdependence of resources while annexing economic and social aspects. A composite index called the WEF Global Index is developed, which involves the WEF nexus index and has nine indicators that evaluate the availability, accessibility and regional interdependence of each resource in the water–energy–food nexus. This new index considers the Gross Domestic Product per capita and the involved population. As a case study, the 32 states of Mexico were considered to assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and the security of the water-energy-food nexus at the state level. For this, the composite index was evaluated in the years 2019 and 2020. The results show that from 2019 to 2020, the value of the global index increased in 13 states, in 21 states the security index of the WEF nexus increased, and in 9 states the GDP per capita index increased. On the other hand, the results indicate that in 11 states there was no improvement in the nexus security index due to the increase in water demand, which considerably affected the water availability indicator. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","COVID-19 pandemic; Scenario analysis; Sustainability indicators; Sustainable development, security; Water–energy–food nexus",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138139332

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has renewed the interest of the Sustainable Supply Chain (SSC) stakeholders on sustainability. The stakeholders are now rethinking their business processes and strategy to make them sustainable. In this context, the relevant literature is required to support emerging markets to formulate sustainability-focussed strategies. The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive analysis of potential antecedents that leads towards sustainable development of freight transportation in emerging markets. Design/methodology/approach: Initially, the antecedents of the Sustainable Freight Transport (SFT) system are derived from the literature survey followed by verification from the experts. Then, the potential antecedents are categorized under four (social, organizational, operational and environmental) broad categories. Afterwards, a Neutrosophic Analytic Network Process (N-ANP) method is employed to obtain the priority weights of the identified potential antecedents. Findings: The paper identified and ranked 17 antecedents of the SFT system. According to the study’s findings, the top three antecedents of SFT are “the presence of a multimodal transportation system,” “circularity in SFT” and “traffic congestion management”. The results from the study advocate the promotion of existing multi-modal transport facilities which is promising to achieve sustainability. The results suggested the adoption of the digital twin to manage the transport operations. Originality/value: This study sheds light on how to achieve sustainability in the freight transportation system post-COVID era highlighting the potential antecedents. The study’s findings will assist practitioners in developing SFT strategies in the face of such pandemics in future. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19; Emerging markets; Freight transportation; Neutrosophic analytic network process (N-ANP); Sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138138528

Design/methodology/approach: Using data from an online survey with 382 respondents, an empirical study applying composite-based structural equation modelling was conducted. Sustainable design for food socialisation was hypothesised to directly influence consumers' satisfaction with the general design of FWB, whereas food policy was assumed to have an emergent effect on food literacy. Gender was a control variable used to identify the heterogeneity of the effects. Findings: The results demonstrated that sustainable design for food policy and food literacy positively influence food socialisation and affect consumers' satisfaction with the sustainable design for FWB. Additionally, women exhibited higher application of food knowledge and skills but less experience in FWB than men.

Here, we collected soil samples from 47 sites across 2500 km in coastal and inland areas of eastern Australia with contrasting status of aridity. We found that the diversity of both bacteria and fungi significantly differed between inland and coastal soils. Despite the significant differences in soil nutrient availability and stoichiometry between the inland and coastal regions, aridity was the most important predictor of bacterial and fungal community compositions. Aridity has altered the potential microbial migration rates and further impacted the microbial assembly processes by increasing the importance of stochasticity in bacterial and fungal communities. More importantly, ecological network analysis indicated that aridity enhanced the complexity and stability of the bacterial network but reduced that of the fungal network, possibly due to the contrasting impacts of aridity on the community-level habitat niche breadth and overlaps. Our work paves the way towards a more comprehensive understanding of how climate changes will alter soil microbial communities, which is integral to predicting their long-term consequences for ecosystem sustainability and resilience to future disturbances. © 2022 The Authors.

Collaborative learning has rarely been investigated using action research methods in the context of environmental citizenship in higher education; the purpose of this study is to fill the gap. Design/methodology/approach: Adopting Bandura's (2012) theory of self-efficacy and collective efficacy, this study explores how collaborative learning, used throughout an action research-based course, encouraged students’ efficacy to implement environmental citizenship in their communities. Data were collected through multiple sources: students’ written reflections, instructors’ reflective journals and continuous discussions, interviews with students and different documents (course syllabi, lesson plans and students' scientific posters). Findings: The findings of this study indicate that the authors succeeded in creating an appropriate social academic setting for the students to become acquainted with each other and to share ideas, successes and challenges in an accepting atmosphere, which proved beneficial to developing their self-confidence to promote EfS in practice. Adopting collaborative learning in the context of environmental citizenship also increased students' self-efficacy and collective efficacy. Self-efficacy was strengthened in the four sources discussed by Bandura (2012): mastery experiences, social modeling, social persuasion and emotional states. Collective efficacy was developed both in the academic and practical domains. Originality/value: The findings of this study suggest that collaborative learning could serve as a powerful way to promote EfS in higher education, especially in teacher education. This contribution was achieved through integrating academic and practical knowledge foundations, which are required to implement environmental citizenship successfully, supporting learners’ initial steps towards becoming change agents in the society. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Action research; Collaborative learning; Collective efficacy; Environmental citizenship; Self-efficacy",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138121440

OPW is produced in millions of tonnes over the world and returned to the environment with little benefit. As a result, there is an urgent need to develop better methods to effectively upcycle the industry's enormous volume of OPW produced yearly. Recent advances in 3D printing technology have enabled food to be created into unique and complex 3D structures with potential benefits to health and environment. Thus, the objective of this research is to develop a method to upcycle OPW into healthy snacks using 3D printing technology such as direct ink writing (DIW). Using DIW 3D printing, an edible 3D structures of orange peels using rheology-modified inks containing OPW was successfully fabricated.

The banana export trade that supplies North America, Europe, and other wealthy nations has a history fraught with exploitation and conflict. The price of cheap bananas has been environmental degradation, violence, and poverty. Only recently have efforts to address the power imbalances in this trade been made. Voluntary certification schemes aim to address multiple sustainability issues, while research into biological control, accelerated plant breeding, and efficient irrigation will help prepare the industry for emerging threats from pests, diseases, and climate change. Summary: Bananas are the world's favorite dessert fruit, a staple starch crop for millions, and an important source of income for producers across the tropics and subtropics. Bananas evolved and diversified as giant perennial herbs of open habitats within the humid forests of Southeast Asia and West Oceania and were domesticated around 7000 years BP through a series of hybridization events. This review considers the journey from rainforest riversides to intensively managed monoculture plantations, focussing on the Cavendish banana that comprises nearly the entire global export trade. Climate change increasingly threatens economic sustainability in several major producer regions, requiring responses such as efficient irrigation systems to maintain productivity and water security. Pests and diseases are spreading globally and have severe direct impacts on production as well as indirect impacts via harm to ecological and human health caused by pesticides. New pest and disease management methods employing biological controls and enhancing soil health and new plant breeding techniques must be developed and implemented. The banana production and trade system has been characterized by power imbalances between international firms that own plantations and supply the market and the local agricultural workers who cultivate and harvest the fruit. Voluntary certification schemes have been developed to address the numerous environmental, social, and economic sustainability issues faced by the industry. There are indications, from research on biological disease control to new deals on wages and benefits for banana workers, that change is slowly coming to the global banana trade. © 2022 The Author.

Additionally, the implications of environmental-control technology on environmental quality are also lacking mostly in the context of Indian economy. Thus, this study enlists environmental-control technology and other relevant factors over the period 1980–2018 and employs the novel multiple threshold nonlinear ARDL technique, a model rarely applied in previous studies for updated empirical narratives. Accordingly, the empirical evidence rectifies that the variables converged to long-run equilibrium. Furthermore, from the tercile partial deviations, it is established that at the middle threshold (GDP2W2), pollution shrinks more significantly amid rising income, thereby validating the EKC hypothesis for India. Likewise, environmental-control technologies provided only a short-term insignificant carbon neutrality pathway, whereas they provided long-term insignificant emission increasing effects. This implies that the depth of such technology in India is inadequate to invoke cleaner environments at all times. Likewise, energy consumption and urbanization processes are significant environmental polluters, while trade openness provides insignificant long- and short-term carbon emission effects. Against this background, economic growth within the middle threshold promises a more sustainable environment amid rising national income at all times. Moreover, given its short-term outcomes, strengthening the depth of environmental-control technology is imperative to ensure a long-lasting clean environment in India. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Environmental Kuznets curve; Environmental sustainability; Environmental-related technological innovations; India; Multiple threshold nonlinear ARDL",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138096753

The impacts of ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation on the floral morphology, stomatal characteristics, biochemical properties and essential oil content in leaves have not been investigated in medicinally important ornamental plants like W. chinensis. The present study has evaluated the growth, its leaf, stomatal, and floral characteristics, photosynthetic pigments, various metabolites as well as the essential oil content of W. chinensis under ambient and elevated (ambient + 7.2 kJ m−2 d−1) UV-B (eUV-B) radiation. UV-B exposure stimulated the growth of the test plant indicating the greater chances of its survival under harsh conditions which could be beneficial for ecological sustainability. The leaf thickness, wax deposition, and metabolites such as phenol, proline, anthocyanin, and flavonoids were significantly increased under eUV-B, while the reverse trend was observed for the specific leaf area (SLA) and photosynthetic pigments. Adaxial stomatal density (34.2%) and abaxial stomatal pore surface (146.1%) was also increased; however, the opposite trend was found in abaxial stomatal density (48.6%) and adaxial stomatal pore surface (41.5%). The floral characteristics were positively influenced by the eUV-B. However, yield loss in the form of essential oil content by 39.9% was recorded under eUV-B. Based on GC–MS analysis, an increase in mono-, di-, tri-terpenes, and fatty acids were observed, while sesquiterpene and other aliphatic hydrocarbons showed a reduction under eUV-B treatment. Moreover, α-Pinene, β-Caryophyllene, β-Thujene, β-Myrcene, α-Phellandrene, L-Limonene, Germacrene D, Bicyclogermacrene, δ-Cadinene, Spathulenol, and Shyobunol were identified as the major components of the essential oil. The study concludes that exposure of UV-B radiation was directly beneficial for the floral morphology and unable to aggravate any morphological damage, the protective pigments, and antioxidants which played a strong defensive role in UV-B tolerance. Whereas, UV-B radiation exposure is deleterious to the plant’s commercial importance in terms of yield of essential oil. © 2022, International Society for Tropical Ecology.","Essential oil; Floral morphology; Leaf characteristics; Secondary metabolites; Stomatal characteristics; UV-B radiation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138095381

By investigating the nature and substantiveness of SDG reporting, this study provides exploratory evidence on how companies are taking the initial steps to addressing the SDGs. Design/methodology/approach: A content analysis of SDG disclosures by the top 50 Australian companies was undertaken. This content analysis was guided by the KPMG (2018) SDG disclosure framework. Legitimacy theory was used to interpret the findings, establishing whether such disclosure was substantive or symbolic. Findings: This study reports a moderate level of SDG disclosure among Australian companies. The top five most critical SDGs in Australian context are climate action, gender equality, decent work and economic growth, responsible consumption and production and industry, innovation and infrastructure. The findings also highlight that while the focus of Australian companies is on understanding and prioritizing SDGs, the measurement of SDGs performance needs to increase. Research limitations/implications: This study adds to limited literature on the corporate responses to SDGs by establishing how companies, especially in Australia, are addressing these goals through changes to their reporting systems, thereby communicating their strategic intent in relation to addressing these goals. A focus on symbolic legitimation through SDG disclosure by the Australian companies in this study reaffirms the findings of similar studies and suggests a need for more substantive SDG management and disclosure if these goals are to be adequately addressed by the corporate sector. Practical implications: The findings of this study provide insights into the current practices and future prospects of corporate responses to SDGs. Policy implications could arise in relation to possible approaches for disclosing social and environmental information and the paper argues for a potential need for regulation of non-financial reporting. Originality/value: This study contributes to the limited understanding of the corporate response to an urgent sustainability call made by the UN by providing evidence on how Australian companies are embedding, measuring and reporting the SDGs.

We first discuss the baseline scenario over the period 2021–2040. According to our baseline results, without fundamental changes in fiscal policies, even relatively high growth will not be sufficient to put public debt on a sustainable path. We then conduct four experiments and assess their impact on fiscal accounts, growth, and unemployment: an increase in the efficiency of public spending on infrastructure investment, a gradual reduction in the share of noninterest government spending in GDP, the same gradual reduction in spending combined with a permanent increase in the share of investment in infrastructure in total noninterest government expenditure, and a composite fiscal reform program that combines these individual policies, respectively. The results suggest that public debt sustainability can be achieved, and growth and employment can be promoted, as long as an ambitious fiscal reform program involving tax, spending, and governance reforms is implemented. Importantly, our quantitative analysis shows that, with a well-designed fiscal program, there may be no trade-off between fiscal consolidation and economic growth. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Algeria; DGE model; fiscal policy; macrofiscal vulnerabilities",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138092402

Agriculture sector is playing pivotal role in world food security and energy sustainability. There is high need to optimize the mechanization technologies to increase the yield in limited energy inputs and operation time to fulfill the world growing food demand. This research is mainly focused on the design development and structural analysis aiding with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) approach for Cotton Stalk Puller and Shredder machine (CSPS) to cut the crop leftovers, soil conditioning (shredding the plant waste into soil) and sowing of next crop in single run by conserving input resources. The experimental trials revealed that there is high pressure on cutting blades, chocking of shredder section and excessive pulling load on tractor hitches, which affected the machine's performance. To mitigate deficiencies and design optimization to improve the machine safety/reliability, the structure analysis carried out. Six core components of machine including baseplate, blade, gear system, root digger, pulley and shaft has investigated as per field conditions. The results revealed that the material of blade, root digger and teeth of gear system receiving the high stress under the operational conditions which results the edge wear and damage. The carbonization up to one-millimeter thickness can provide the extra strength to bear the excessive load on edge layers. © 2022 THE AUTHORS","Agricultural Mechanization; Energy conservation; Finite Element Analysis; Food security; Structural analysis","Agricultural machinery; Carbonization; Cotton; Finite element method; Gear teeth; Structural analysis; Sustainable development; Agricultural mechanization; Agriculture sectors; Cotton stalk; Energy inputs; Energy sustainability; Finite element analyse; Food security; Gear system; Limited energies; Mechanisation; Crops",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138064696

Also, for most part, empirical studies on this nexus have assumed a symmetric relationship through the imposition of linear specifications. However, such relationships do not account for asymmetries in the impact of FDI on carbon emissions. In the case of sub-Saharan Africa, such relationships are crucial and need more careful analysis given the important role FDI plays in the development of the sub-region. Thus, this paper examines the asymmetric effect of FDI on carbon emissions in 41 selected sub-Saharan African countries spanning from 1996 to 2018. In order to decompose FDI into positive and negative partial sum and examine possible asymmetric effects of the variables on carbon emissions, we used the panel nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) approach. This method accounts for cross-sectional variances. Our results show that in the long run, a positive shock in FDI increases carbon emissions while a negative shock lowers them. Our results also show that carbon emissions respond asymmetrically to changes in FDI. It is recommended that comprehensive investment policies aimed at encouraging clean technology and environmentally friendly investments be implemented to ensure environmental sustainability. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Asymmetry; Carbon emissions; Environmental quality; Foreign direct investment; Nonlinear ARDL; Pollution",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138063875

In this study, the focus has been drawn on the screening, leading to the use of waste materials for removal of P from wastewater in CWs, which will have an additional benefit of reuse to promote sustainability of resources, by reducing the amount of solid waste for disposal. Studies have been carried out to examine the physicochemical properties of low-cost waste materials and their preliminary phosphorus (P) adsorption capacities. Five construction waste materials have been investigated marble, tile, granite, sanitaryware, and autoclaved aerated concrete as substrates for CWs, for removal of P. Based on the physicochemical properties and preliminary phosphorus adsorption capacity measurement, autoclaved aerated concrete and tile waste showed potential as filler media in CWs. But leaching experiment for AAC showed TP leaching potential as 0.058 mg/g which is an undesired property in filler media for CWs. Therefore, it cannot be considered for use as a component of the substrate matrix. Though the physicochemical properties of other materials were suitable for use as filler media, their adsorption capacity in the preliminary P adsorption test was less. The potential for P adsorption was in the order autoclaved aerated concrete > Tile > Granite > Marble > Sanitary.

The aim of this paper is to describe the Dutch chain approach on medicinal residues in water that has been implemented by the Dutch government. We show how stakeholders from both the health and water sectors have got actively involved. Within this chain approach, source measures as well as end-of-pipe measures are identified and, where feasible and effective, implemented. Methods: Descriptive paper on the Dutch chain approach. Results: Getting the water and health care sectors to talk with each other instead of about each other was the key accomplishment. Comprehension of each other's viewpoints, terminology, policy goals and span of control, was pivotal in setting shared goals, creating perspective about possible measures and actually taking (joint) action. Together, stakeholders agreed to act within their own possibilities, without pointing at others, and to focus on pragmatic measures. In this article, we provide examples of measures taken, pilot projects performed, and of measures that were not implemented. Besides this, we discuss the most important barriers encountered during this process and how they were overcome. Conclusion: The issue of pharmaceuticals in the environment is a wicked problem, which makes it necessary to work together with many stakeholders on possible solutions, avoiding paralysis by complexity. Most importantly, stakeholders need to invest in mutual understanding, keep an open communication, and feel invited to bring in solutions for their part of the chain. © 2022 The Authors.

Methods: A conceptual framework was developed and based on 2 theories for implementation in dental practices. The framework covered 4 levels: structural, dental practice, oral health care practitioner, and method and product level. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect guided and in-depth data. Fourteen key stakeholders were interviewed: dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants, managers and owners of dental practices, and suppliers of dental goods. Data were analysed using both a thematic analysis approach and open coding. Results: Participants were aware of the compromised planetary health and, in part, of their contribution to it. However, turning this awareness into action proved to be challenging. Barriers that were identified included limited knowledge and awareness of the largest sources of planetary burden in oral health care. Also, information and availability of sustainable products and methods cannot yet meet the requirements of current performance standards, costs, and infection control guidelines. Facilitators that were observed included a growing awareness to contribute to planetary health and to implement sustainability outside oral health care, especially in women and younger people. Overviews and guides of existing sustainable methods are available, but additional methods and products should be developed as well. Conclusions: Many participants considered infection control guidelines as the most prominent barrier to sustainable oral health care. Women felt more involved with planetary health compared to men, which is in line with the concept of ecofeminism. It is essential for stakeholders to collaborate to reach the next levels of implementation. Action is required on all levels to secure both oral and planetary health.

Various organizations rank green or non-green universities under several criteria. The results obtained in these rankings make it possible to compare the performances of similar universities. In this study, we aim to look at the ranking of green universities from the perspective of multi-criteria decision-making. For this purpose, according to the UI GreenMetric 2021 report, 35 green universities in Europe are ranked using the multi-attributive border approximation area comparison method with Gini coefficient-based weighting method. As a result of the weight calculation with the Gini coefficient-based weighting method, it is found out that the setting and infrastructure criterion is the most important criterion, whereas the least important criterion is waste. The performance scores of green universities are obtained by using the calculated criteria weights and the Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison method. Consequently, the correlation between the original ranking and the ranking obtained by the proposed methodology used in this study has been found as 0.8151. These results show that multi-criteria decision-making methods can be used to rank green universities. As a result of the findings obtained in this study, underperformed universities in the ranking may find the opportunity to compare themselves with similar green universities.

One of the most examined byproducts for this purpose is steel slag. However, existing studies do not explore the blending of different slags to enhance the engineering performance of base layers. The applicability of Linz–Donawitz (LD), Blast Furnace (BF) and Kambara Reactor (KR) steel byproducts is evaluated as a single base layer for rural (unsurfaced) roads in Brazil. A series of laboratory experiments were performed to assess the characteristics of eight soil-byproduct mixtures with 50% and 75% byproduct contents, including new blends of LD/KR and BF/KR slags. Additionally, the most suitable mixture was proposed considering different performance indicators. Results demonstrate the coarse-grained, nonplastic and non-expansive nature of the byproducts, with CBR values higher than 100%. The more byproduct added to soil, the larger is the strength and the lower the expansion. The mixture with 75% of the proposed LD/KR blend and 25% of a clayey soil was considered as optimum, based on a trade-off between engineering properties, environmental impacts, and material costs.

Recent research in masonry has been tailored towards the production of energy-efficient building by incorporating waste materials as additives. This effectuates a safe waste disposal, cost effectiveness, and also serve as a giant stride towards environmental sustainability. This study examines the viability of using walnut shell as additive in fired clay at various firing temperatures. Pulverized walnut shell was added to clay at a proportion of 0–10 wt.% by weight of clay. The samples were fired at temperatures of 950 °C and 1100 °C. The samples were probed for mechanical properties and durability. Morphology of the brick samples were examined under scanning electron microscope. The result of the research showed increased water absorption and specific heat capacity while mechanical and bulk density were observed to reduce. Linear shrinkage and thermal conductivity reduced with increase in walnut content of which linear shrinkage and thermal conductivity values experienced at 1100 °C was higher than at 950 °C. Resistance of bricks to salt crystallization increased with firing temperature. All samples met various standard requirement for masonry except sample prepared with 10 wt.% walnut shell whose compressive and flexural strengths fell below the required standard. The study established the use of walnut shell for development of sustainable energy-efficient bricks. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Eco-efficiency; Fired bricks; Masonry, Walnut shell; Waste management",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138025123

To further clarify whether or not natural resource rent affects environmental sustainability, this study investigates the potential impact of natural resource rent on environmental sustainability by addressing the interaction effect of urbanization and natural resource rent for data spanning from 1971 to 2017 in the context of Pakistan. Ecological footprint, carbon emissions, and carbon footprint are used as indicators for environmental sustainability. The application of the dynamic autoregressive distributive lag method infers that the natural resource rent contributes to carbon emission and alternatively urbanization helps pollution mitigation. The interaction between urbanization and natural resource rent plays a moderating role in reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, ecological and carbon footprint. The co-efficient value of natural resources, urbanization and interaction effect of urbanization with natural resource ranging from 0.021 to 0.788; 0.287 to 1.689 and 0.033 to 0.320, respectively.

According to transition management theory, which emphasizes the active role of firms as accelerators of global transition processes, and based on qualitative content analysis of the literature, we found key pillars of CE (governance, relations with stakeholders and innovation) that SMEs should manage in an integrated way to increase the speed of the transition towards circularity. The result of this study is a conceptual framework that explains the development of the identified pillars in the context of the transition towards CE. This study addresses a gap in the literature concerning SMEs’ transition towards circularity, emphasizing the importance of a dynamic vision and the integrated management of a variety of key dimensions. The study also provides pragmatic advice to facilitate self-assessments by SMEs with respect to their path of transition and to maximize the effectiveness of policy-makers’ interventions to support SMEs. Finally, the study has societal implications: promoting the transition of SMEs towards CE can accelerate the global green transition due to the proximity of SMEs to the local environment and work force. © 2022, The Author(s).","Circular economy; SMEs; Sustainability management; Transition management theory",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138017047

Fly-ash-based geopolymer (FLAG) concrete has been used in the construction industry for more than one and a half decades. The compressive strength (CS) of concrete plays a crucial role in the mechanical properties of concrete. Laboratory experiments take a huge amount of time and cost to estimate the CS of concrete. Although analytical methods exist to estimate the CS of concrete, but these models cannot forecast the CS of concrete with better precision due to the complexity of the design mixes. The machine learning (ML)-based models have been helpful in estimating the CS of concrete with high accuracy and reliability. In this article, four ML algorithms (support vector machine [SVM], linear regression [LR], ensemble learning [EL], and Gaussian process regression [GPR]) and three optimized ML algorithms (EL, SVM, and GPR) have been used to estimate the CS of FLAG concrete. The R-value of LR, EL, SVMR, GPR, optimized EL, optimized SVMR and optimized GPR models are 0.8916, 0.9172, 0.9313, 0.9529, 0.9459, 0.9348 and 0.9590, respectively. The accuracy of the optimized GPR model with an R-value of 0.9590 and RMSE value of 1.7132 MPa outperformed all other ML models. The performances of all the developed models have been illustrated through Taylor diagram and error plot. The feature importance of the input parameters has been explained with the explainable ML technique. The developed, optimized GPR model can be reliable tool to estimate the CS with greater accuracy and also reducing time and cost. © 2022 fib.

Objective: The aim of this study is to explore DSMES from the community pharmacists’ perspectives, identify barriers and facilitators to pharmacist DSMES implementation, and guide development of pharmacist-provided DSMES programs in Idaho. Methods: Implementation climate, the theoretical framework for this project, is focused on how community pharmacists in Idaho perceive they will be supported by patients, health care providers, and insurers in DSMES implementation. Pharmacist investigators with qualitative research experience conducted semistructured interviews with 6 licensed community pharmacists from Idaho via Zoom between March and June 2020. Recordings were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using HyperRESEARCH 4.5.1. Themes, patterns, and dominant concepts that emerged from respondents’ about DSMES were explored, labeled, and categorized into modifiable and nonmodifiable barriers and facilitators. This study was granted expedited approval by the Idaho State University Investigational Review Board. Results: Relevant themes included current scope of practice, barriers, and facilitators. Subthemes related to the current scope of pharmacy practice included unclear roles and responsibilities and legislative constraints to practice. For barriers, subthemes included cost of set-up, billing and coding education, and the sustainability of services based on current reimbursement models. For facilitators, subthemes included the need for additional collaborations (external and internal), technology access, and trained pharmacy staff. Conclusion: Pharmacists are underutilized health care providers, capable of providing DSMES services if provided the necessary resources. This work identifies barriers and facilitators to pharmacist-led DSMES that can be considered by others when implementing DSMES or other disease management services. © 2022",,,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138014833

Through incorporating the DBI in electronic medical records (eMR) and implementing a DBI stewardship program, we aimed to determine (i) uptake of the steward's recommendations to deprescribe anticholinergic and/or sedative drugs by the medical team and (ii) whether accepted recommendations were actioned in hospital or recommended for follow-up by the General Practitioner post-discharge. Methods: A single-arm, non-randomised feasibility study was performed at an Australian tertiary referral metropolitan hospital. The stewardship pharmacist reviewed eMRs of patients aged ≥75 years with DBI scores > 0, during admission. The steward identified and discussed potential opportunities to deprescribe anticholinergic and/or sedative medications with the medical registrars. Results: Amongst 256 patients reviewed, the steward made 170 recommendations for 117 patients. Registrars agreed with 141 recommendations (82.9%) for 95 patients (81.2%), and actioned 115 deprescribing recommendations for 80 patients, most commonly for antidepressants and opioids. The 115 actioned recommendations resulted in 125 changes, with 44 changes to the inpatient drug chart and 81 additional changes recommended post-discharge in the discharge summary. Conclusion: Opportunities exist for deprescribing anticholinergic and sedative medications in older inpatients and a DBI stewardship program may help implement these. It is important to capture different outcomes of deprescribing interventions, including in-hospital medication changes, recommendations in the Discharge Summary, sustainability of deprescribing and clinical outcomes. © 2022 The Authors.

Given the potential effect of environmental degradation associated with the trend of ecological deficit of these countries, this study attempts to understand the contribution of renewable energy dimensions through the measure of renewable energy efficiency and renewable energy use alongside evaluating the role of the four main aspects of economic freedom. By using empirical tools, the findings revealed that renewable energy aspects contribute to environmental sustainability among the countries through a significant mitigation of their ecological footprint. Importantly, the aspects of economic freedom, that is, government size, legal system and property rights, freedom to trade internationally, and regulation hampers environmental sustainability by increasing the countries ecological footprint. The elasticity of impact of this dimension of economic freedom is in the range of 0.19–0.21 at 1% statistically significant level. However, population of these countries does not show a detrimental effect, rather the finding revealed that population improves environmental quality by a statistically significant degree.

Yet, data on populations and harvest sizes are limited. We used a demographic invariant method (DIM) to estimate potential excess growth (PEG) for populations of UK wintering waterbirds and calculated a sustainable harvest index (SHI) for each. We compared this with population trends and conservation classifications (e.g. Birds of Conservation Concern [BoCC]) to assess the sustainability of harvests and the utility of these classifications. Our approach found evidence for potential overharvest of mallard Anas platyrhynchos, Eurasian teal Anas crecca, gadwall Mareca strepera, Canada geese Branta canadensis, greylag geese Anser anser and woodcock Scolopax rusticola. Whether DIM methods predict overharvest is highly dependent on estimates of maximum population growth rates inferring PEG. We found estimates of maximum population growth to be variable across a range of different methods. We found no relationship between SHI and short-term wintering trends or conservation classification under the UK's BoCC framework. There was however a positive relationship between SHI and long-term wintering trends. Policy implications. Our results suggest that UK-based harvest is unlikely to be a major determinant of population trends for the majority of UK overwintering waterbirds, but harvest rates for some species may exceed that required to maintain stationary population growth. The lack of a relationship between conservation classifications and SHI strongly suggests that such conservation classifications are not an appropriate tool for making decisions about harvest management. Instead, our assessment provides the basis for a framework to make evidence-based decisions on sustainable harvest levels in the face of incomplete data. There is currently no clear policy instrument in the UK to support such a framework via controls on either harvest effort or mortality of waterfowl. We believe such an instrument is urgently needed to ensure the UK can adapt to changing pressures and ensure the sustainable use of our wildlife populations. © 2022 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: A growing body of research suggests that gender is central to placemaking, and in dealing with environmental sustainability, fear of crime, longer life expectancy, unpaid work and economic inequality shape mobility and experiences of the city for women. In this context, the authors conducted a series of interviews with women in Greater Manchester and explored how they envision a city with clean air. Findings: Findings suggest that the conceptualization of a city with cleaner air is influenced by a range of both direct and indirect factors including safety, pleasantness, greenspace, litter and homelessness. Consequently, these can be powerful elements in designing relevant policies for women and for society at large and in communicating them effectively. Research limitations/implications: The major limitation of this study is that whilst it gives voice to women with different backgrounds (e.g. age, ethnicity or professional background) and experiences (e.g. number of children or preferred form of transport), it is not an encompassing voice of all women. For example, although the professional backgrounds of these women are diverse, they all hold a position of relative economic privilege, and as such it is important to acknowledge that these findings do not fully incorporate the voices of other, less privileged, women. Originality/value: These interviews and their analysis present a novel exploration of the question of air quality and placemaking from a gender perspective, highlighting both a willingness to change and to support structural changes. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Air pollution; Gender; Placemaking; Sustainability; Urban environment",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138003575

RESULTS: Impregnation with 0.5 mol L−1 ZnCl2 (POSC5) produced the highest specific surface area with dominant micropores of 89% in a total volume of 0.343 cm3 g−1. POSC5 was shown to have an excellent morphological combination of trimodal-foam-sponge-like hierarchical porosity with large messy short 2D nano-rod structures as the optimum carbon preparation. A symmetrical system was designed as a solid electrode without a binder, confirming high capacitive properties of 256 F g−1 in 1 mol L−1 H2SO4 electrolyte with capacitance retention of 76% at 10 mV s−1. The results showed that the transport and resistance behavior of the charge tends to be stable and satisfactory at an internal resistance of 0.012 Ω, with the energy density increased from 9.14 to 21.19 W h kg−1 at 1 A g−1 in 1 mV s−1. CONCLUSION: Therefore, this research provides an environmentally benign and novel approach for developing a high-quality, sustainable biomass carbon-based electrode material for electrochemical energy storage applications. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI). © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).","electrode; hierarchical porous; nanostructure; palm oil stick; supercapacitor","Biomass; Carbon; Chemical industry; Chlorine compounds; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytes; Nanorods; Palm oil; Structural optimization; Zinc chloride; Carbon nano-structures; Carbon-based electrodes; Electrochemical performance; Hierarchical porous; Hierarchical porous carbons; High specific surface area; High-temperature pyrolysis; Novel precursors; Oil stocks; Palm oil stick; Supercapacitor",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138003038

To clarify what organizations have been involved and what project types exist within VET cooperation, a semistructured survey had been conducted for collecting data. By this approach, 99 VET project profiles with 258 organizations related were detected. To analyse these projects and organizations, the ‘general key factor model of sustainability’ is used to structure the analysis framework. In this framework, ‘cooperation type’, ‘content type’ and ‘project duration’ were considered as the three fundamental criteria for further categorization. On this basis, seven cooperation types were created by the organizations involved, three content types were established by the goal of the project and three project duration were distinguished by the time planned for the project. The result shows that governmental organizations are the main actors who play a major role in the Sino-German VET cooperation. However, numerically, German private organizations participated more in VET cooperation rather than Chinese private organizations. Civil social organizations show no significant function. Meanwhile, different cooperation types show different projects' emphasis: Type G (Governmental) projects focus on building or promoting on the organization level; Type G + P (Governmental + Private) projects tend to objectives on the individual and system level; Type G + C (Governmental + Civil) projects occur more often at an individual level; Type G + P + C (Governmental + Private + Civil) projects tend to pursue goals on organizational or system level. © 2022 The Authors.

In this research, we developed a series of polyimides derived from (3 R,6 S)-hexahydrofuro[3,2-b]furan-3,6-diyl bis(1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carboxylate) (ISBESA), which can be synthesized from isosorbide bioresources. This study systematically analyzed the effect of ester or amide linkage presence and orientation on the performance of polyimides (PIs). The PI chain configuration and morphology were investigated via experimental results such as d-spacing or film density and theoretical calculations. After introducing the stiff ester linkage, PI-1 with a high chain coplanarity and stacking state exhibits a low water absorption of 0.34 and possesses outstanding thermal/mechanical stability, with a Tg higher than 300 °C, a CTE of 27.8 ppm K–1, and a Young’s modulus of 4.4 GPa, which is superior to those of most reported biopolymers and even Kapton® engineering plastics. In addition, PI-1 exhibits low dielectric properties, with a Dk of 2.84 and a Df of 0.004, due to the low chain polarity and dipole moment. We further demonstrate a flexible transistor based on PI-1 that shows electrical performance comparable to those of traditional silicon-based devices, even after thermal treatment at 150 °C or 1000 bending cycles. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Society of Polymer Science, Japan.",,"Amides; Biopolymers; Dielectric properties; Esters; Flexible electronics; Sustainable development; Thermal Engineering; Thermodynamic stability; Water absorption; Biomass-based polymer; Bioresource; Electronics applications; Environmental sustainability; Ester linkages; High thermal stability; Isosorbide; Low water; Synthesised; Thermally stable; Polyimides",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138000610

In this study, we therefore analyze the relationship between a buyer firm's transformational leadership and supplier relational stability and examine whether it is moderated by the buyer firm being affected by automation and globalization. We test our assumptions using data from a survey of German Mittelstand firms and confirm the moderating roles of automation and globalization.

Yet information about how rangeland soil features influence livestock production has lagged relative to agronomic crop production. We established a ranch-scale assessment in Wyoming, USA to better understand soil health and livestock production. We integrated 26 years of animal day per hectare grazing records to relate livestock production to pasture-scale soil characteristics. In 2017, we measured 23 soil variables, and 11 forage variables (for Pascopyrum smithii) of 11 grazed pastures from 68 to 146 ha and three ungrazed exclosures. Pastures were stratified across animal day pasture categories (“Low,” “Medium,” “High,” and “None” or exclosure; considered a carrying capacity index). Significant relationships were found between nine of the 23 soil response variables but only one of the 11 forage response variables relative to the animal day pasture categories. Statistical analysis indicated significantly higher % soil organic carbon and forage lignin in the High animal day pasture category relative to the Low Animal Day pasture category (both p-values <0.05). No significant relationship was found between the Animal Day pasture category and forage crude protein (p = 0.3). The principal component analysis explained 98.22% (cumulative for the first two axes) of the variation of the soil health variables but was less insightful for forage quality variables (71.1% of variation explained). Soil organic carbon is a suitable indicator of animal days in pasture and may serve as a useful rangeland soil health indicator for livestock producers. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Animal days; baseline; forage quality; organic carbon; ranch-scale; soil health",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137998046

Consequently, governments across the globe are committing to achieving decarbonizing the environment with a target aimed at 2050, of which China is a key player. In effect, this study seeks to contribute to the strides by querying the extent to which shocks in technological innovation make or mar the sustainability of the Chinese environment from 1990 to 2019. The other impacts of foreign direct investment, renewable and nonrenewable energy, and economic growth are considered in the model estimated through nonlinear ARDL robust for ascertaining instantaneous positive and negative effects. The results reveal that technological innovation promotes and hinders environmental sustainability based on the positive and negative shocks, respectively, whereas the adverse shocks impede it. Besides, economic growth and nonrenewable energy turn out to be negative predictors of environmental sustainability while renewable energy and FDI facilitate it. The results of the Fourier Toda Yamamoto corroborate the NARDL results. The EKC hypothesis is not validated for China based on estimates from the novel Itkonen (2012) approach.

However, the practical implementation of content analysis is extremely laborintensive and subject to human coder errors. Applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques can help address these limitations. We explain and illustrate these techniques to psychological researchers. For this purpose, we first present a study exploring the creation of psychometrically meaningful predictions of human content codes. Using an existing database of human content codes, we build an NLP algorithm to validly predict those codes, at generally acceptable standards. We then conduct a Monte-Carlo simulation to model how four dataset characteristics (i.e., sample size, unlabeled proportion of cases, classification base rate, and human coder reliability) influence content classification performance. The simulation indicated that the influence of sample size and unlabeled proportion on model classification performance tended to be curvilinear. In addition, base rate and human coder reliability had a strong effect on classification performance. Finally, using these results, we offer practical recommendations to psychologists on the necessary dataset characteristics to achieve valid prediction of content codes to guide researchers on the use of NLP models to replace human coders in content analysis research. © 2022 American Psychological Association","Content analysis; Environmental sustainability; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Text classification","algorithm; article; content analysis; environmental sustainability; human; human experiment; machine learning; Monte Carlo method; natural language processing; prediction; psychologist; reliability; sample size; simulation",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137995428

Design/methodology/approach: The mixed-method approach was applied to assess sustainability dimensions and calculate the score using two phases. In Phase I, the BDA drivers in the e-commerce industry were finalised using the partial least square based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) method. In Phase II, a case study in the Indian fashion e-commerce industry was carried out to evaluate sustainability dimensions with respect to drivers of BDA and the sustainability score was calculated using the fuzzy analytical hierarchical process (AHP) method. Findings: The index for economic sustainability (0.220), social sustainability (0.142) and environmental sustainability (0.182) were derived. The higher index value of economic sustainability compared to social sustainability and environmental sustainability signified those drivers of big data bring social and environmental uncertainty along with economic sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The study will help practitioners promote BDA use for developing environmental/social/economic sustainability in supply chains. Policymakers must ensure whether the integration of BDA practices brings down cost and brings strategic value for ensuring big data success. The study will help managers decide a constant trade-off between the requirement for social, environmental and economic performance. Originality/value: The study corroborates and adds to the BDA literature by emphasising the positive role of BDA in sustainability development in the supply chain area and highlighting the significant role of different drivers of BDA in sustainability development. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AHP; Big data; e-commerce; Structural equation modelling; Survey; Sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137994018

To achieve the study objective, a fuzzy decision-making modeling technique is applied. The results revealed that bank loans are now the main source of financing for innovation and creativity in Chinese business entities. Project-based financing might be replaced with collaborative and sustainable energy innovation (CSI), warranting energy development. Moreover, green financing loan schemes invest both public and private funds in sustainable energy innovation to capitalize on financial development through sustainable energy innovation. The consideration and application of financial consideration for sustainable energy innovation-financing projects or companies are limitless. Providing for screening energy development cooperation proposals with small financial payback hurdle rates might have large opportunity costs. There may be a case for governments to increase industrial growth, improve resource efficiency, and increase factor productivity while tackling climate change. Economic growth in China may have an even greater influence on environmental sustainability than in other countries. On such points, there is a need to pay the attention. If the suggested policy suggestions are implemented successfully, they would help to enhance the scope of financing considerations for sustainable energy innovation to uplift financial development through energy development mechanisms at the corporate level. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bank loans; Energy development; Energy financing considerations; Financial development; Fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS; Sustainable energy innovation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137989398

We find that the emissions of pollutant gases decrease in comparable proportion to the market share of the electric vehicles. When only users with shorter trips switch to electric vehicles, the impact is limited and demand for charging stations is small since most users will charge by night at home. When the government is able to target users with longer trips, the impact can be higher by more than a factor of two.

The advent of the so-called “New Space” race, age, or era characterized by democratization, commercialization, militarization, and overlapping outer space activities such as tourism presents challenges for disaster-related and health-related risks in and for outer space. Such challenges have been extensively researched for earth, but less so for space. This article presents an overview of key aspects for addressing disaster and health risks in outer space within a wider sustainability framing. After an introduction providing background and scope, this article's next section considers some key health and disaster risks within sustainable outer space and offers insights from earth. The following two sections apply this knowledge by focusing on how analogue missions and international legal and voluntary regimes can each be used to reduce risks and potentially make outer space healthier and safer. The findings advocate that there is a wealth of knowledge and experience about mitigating risks to health and disaster risk reduction on earth that can inform spaceflight and exploration. The examples explored include the physical, legal, and regulatory aspects of the “New Space” industry, which highlights the relevance of equating examples on earth. The article concludes that expectations must be managed regarding scenarios for which response, rescue, and recovery are precluded, prompting a necessary focus on prevention and risk reduction. In doing so, earth-based scenarios and aspects of the so-called “Old Space” offer useful insights and should be examined further for “New Space.” Integr Environ Assess Manag 2022;00:1–8. © 2022 The Authors.

According to reports, exposure to high concentrations of radioactive elements such as potassium (40K), uranium (238U and 235U), and thorium (232Th) poses serious health concerns. The scarcity of reviews addressing the occurrence/sources, distribution, and remedial solutions of radioactive contamination in the ecosystems has fueled data collection for this bibliometric survey. In rivers and potable water, reports show that several parts of Europe and Asia have recorded radionuclide concentrations much higher than the permissible level of 1 Bq/L. According to various investigations, activity concentrations of gamma-emitting radioactive elements discovered in soils are higher than the global average crustal values, especially around mining activities. Adsorption technique is the most prevalent remedial method for decontaminating radiochemically polluted sites. However, there is a need to investigate integrated approaches/combination techniques. Although complete radionuclide decontamination utilizing the various technologies is feasible, future research should focus on cost-effectiveness, waste minimization, sustainability, and rapid radionuclide decontamination. Radioactive materials can be harnessed as fuel for nuclear power generation to meet worldwide energy demand. However, proper infrastructure must be put in place to prevent catastrophic disasters. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Environment; Nuclear power; Radioactive waste; Radionuclides; Remediation",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137942909

The healthcare industry is a significant part of the problem, especially in highly industrialized countries. China, the European Union and the United States account for 56% of global greenhouse gas emissions from the healthcare sector. Advanced medical imaging technology, pharmaceuticals, single-use medical products, and even travel by patients to the healthcare facilities consume energy and generate waste. With the increased use of medical imaging and the development of new image-guided procedures, radiology has also become a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Countermeasures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining or improving the quality of radiology services is a challenge we must all address. Just as scientific advances come from all parts of the world, solutions to this problem are likely to come from many sources.

Design/methodology/approach: This study explores the potential of TOPSIS in the sustainable redevelopment of abandoned infrastructure in Nigeria through a combination of a quantitative method of data collection – questionnaire – and a case study. The case study focuses on the abandoned Federal Government Secretariat in Lagos. One hundred and sixty-one (161) participants responded to the questionnaire. Data collected were analyzed using TOPSIS analytical technique. Findings: Refurbishment is considered as the most sustainable alternative for the redevelopment of abandoned infrastructure. For criteria consideration, structural integrity and foundation categorized under the technological attributes ranked highest for refurbishment and conversion alternatives. Waste generation and prevention and profitability top the list for demolition and procurement respectively. Social implications: The social benefit of this study is to bring building considered to be an eyesore back into use. Originality/value: The findings from the analysis orchestrates the importance of the built environment research concentrating on innovative frameworks for sustainable redevelopment of abandoned structures in the construction industry. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Abandoned; Infrastructure; Redevelopment; Refurbishment; Sustainable development; TOPSIS",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137940117

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources: Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, and CINAHL were searched from database inception until May 2021. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Observational studies assessing the association of physician burnout (including a feeling of overwhelming emotional exhaustion, feelings of cynicism and detachment from job defined as depersonalisation, and a sense of ineffectiveness and little personal accomplishment) with career engagement (job satisfaction, career choice regret, turnover intention, career development, and productivity loss) and the quality of patient care (patient safety incidents, low professionalism, and patient satisfaction). Data were double extracted by independent reviewers and checked through contacting all authors, 84 (49%) of 170 of whom confirmed their data. Random-effect models were used to calculate the pooled odds ratio, prediction intervals expressed the amount of heterogeneity, and meta-regressions assessed for potential moderators with significance set using a conservative level of P<0.10. Results: 4732 articles were identified, of which 170 observational studies of 239 246 physicians were included in the meta-analysis. Overall burnout in physicians was associated with an almost four times decrease in job satisfaction compared with increased job satisfaction (odds ratio 3.79, 95% confidence interval 3.24 to 4.43, I2=97%, k=73 studies, n=146 980 physicians). Career choice regret increased by more than threefold compared with being satisfied with their career choice (3.49, 2.43 to 5.00, I2=97%, k=16, n=33 871). Turnover intention also increased by more than threefold compared with retention (3.10, 2.30 to 4.17, I2=97%, k=25, n=32 271). Productivity had a small but significant effect (1.82, 1.08 to 3.07, I2=83%, k=7, n=9581) and burnout also affected career development from a pooled association of two studies (3.77, 2.77 to 5.14, I2=0%, n=3411). Overall physician burnout doubled patient safety incidents compared with no patient safety incidents (2.04, 1.69 to 2.45, I2=87%, k=35, n=41 059). Low professionalism was twice as likely compared with maintained professionalism (2.33, 1.96 to 2.70, I2=96%, k=40, n=32 321), as was patient dissatisfaction compared with patient satisfaction (2.22, 1.38 to 3.57, I2=75%, k=8, n=1002). Burnout and poorer job satisfaction was greatest in hospital settings (1.88, 0.91 to 3.86, P=0.09), physicians aged 31-50 years (2.41, 1.02 to 5.64, P=0.04), and working in emergency medicine and intensive care (2.16, 0.98 to 4.76, P=0.06); burnout was lowest in general practitioners (0.16, 0.03 to 0.88, P=0.04). However, these associations did not remain significant in the multivariable regressions. Burnout and patient safety incidents were greatest in physicians aged 20-30 years (1.88, 1.07 to 3.29, P=0.03), and people working in emergency medicine (2.10, 1.09 to 3.56, P=0.02). The association of burnout with low professionalism was smallest in physicians older than 50 years (0.36, 0.19 to 0.69, P=0.003) and greatest in physicians still in training or residency (2.27, 1.45 to 3.60, P=0.001), in those who worked in a hospital (2.16, 1.46 to 3.19, P<0.001), specifically in emergency medicine specialty (1.48, 1.01 to 2.34, P=0.042), or situated in a low to middle income country (1.68, 0.94 to 2.97, P=0.08). Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides compelling evidence that physician burnout is associated with poor function and sustainability of healthcare organisations primarily by contributing to the career disengagement and turnover of physicians and secondarily by reducing the quality of patient care. Healthcare organisations should invest more time and effort in implementing evidence-based strategies to mitigate physician burnout across specialties, and particularly in emergency medicine and for physicians in training or residency.

For a sustainable design of reinforced and prestressed concrete bridges in the ultimate limit state and serviceability limit state, a realistic estimation of the torsional stiffness as a function of the load level is necessary. Due to the current limited number of studies, normative bases for the recalculation of bridge structures are only available to a limited extent and are not intended for the design of new bridge constructions. The present article gives an overview of the torsional load-bearing behavior and, in particular, the torsional stiffness of reinforced and prestressed concrete structures with T-beam cross sections. The focus is on the redistribution of internal forces in the overall system associated with the reduction of torsional stiffness, which leads, among other things, to lower design torsional moments and consequently to a smaller amount of reinforcement required for torsional loading. This is explained clearly using a parameter study with the Bieger model and the example of a bridge recalculation as well as the design of a new bridge in prestressed concrete construction. , Ernst und Sohn.

Driven by recent advances in emerging technologies such as extended reality, artificial intelligence, and blockchain, metaverse is stepping from science fiction to an upcoming reality. However, severe privacy invasions and security breaches (inherited from underlying technologies or emerged in the new digital ecology) of metaverse can impede its wide deployment. At the same time, a series of fundamental challenges (e.g., scalability and interoperability) can arise in metaverse security provisioning owing to the intrinsic characteristics of metaverse, such as immersive realism, hyper spatiotemporality, sustainability, and heterogeneity. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the fundamentals, security, and privacy of metaverse. Specifically, we first investigate a novel distributed metaverse architecture and its key characteristics with ternary-world interactions. Then, we discuss the security and privacy threats, present the critical challenges of metaverse systems, and review the state-of-the-art countermeasures. Finally, we draw open research directions for building future metaverse systems.

To achieve these aims, the local community of which the RWL is a part should be in close collaboration from the start of a project. RWLs offer spaces for ‘thinking outside the box’ and for experimenting with new ideas through concrete interventions into the life world of the community. We provide methodological guidance for researchers on how to design interventions in RWLs that both affect change on the ground and contribute to scientific knowledge. This includes addressing issues important to local communities and generating transformation knowledge about how sustainable urban development can be actualised. We use the case of a project-based master’s course within an RWL in the city of Zurich in Switzerland to demonstrate how the use of design thinking supported the development of needs-based interventions, curbing emissions from food consumption while aiming to generate scientifically relevant output. We conclude that further improvements in methodology are needed in order to test the effectiveness of interventions.

Recent research suggests that a transdisciplinary approach to landscape management can help identify common research needs, enhance knowledge co-production, guide evidence-based policy development, and harmonize cross-sectorial integration. Meanwhile, guiding principles for landscape approaches suggest that identifying common concerns and negotiating a process of change are fundamental to implementation and evaluation efforts. As such, the use of decision support tools such as theory of change models that build ordered sequences of actions towards a desired, and agreed, future state are increasingly advocated. However, the application of the theory of change concept to integrated landscape approaches is limited thus far, particularly within the scientific literature. Here, we address this gap by applying the principles of landscape approaches and knowledge co-production to co-produce a theory of change to address current unsustainable landscape management and associated conflicts in the Kalomo Hills Local Forest Reserve No. P.13 (KFR13) of Zambia. The participatory process engaged a diverse range of stakeholders including village head people, local and international researchers, district councillors, and civil society representatives amongst others. Several pathways, actions, and interventions were developed around the themes of deforestation, biodiversity and wildlife conservation, socio-economic development, access rights, and law enforcement. To make the theory of change actionable, participants identified a need for enhanced cross-sector and multi-level communication, capacity development, and improved governance, while a lack of commitment towards coordinated knowledge exchange and access to information along with poor policy formulation and weak enforcement of rules were among potential impediments to action. Use of theory of change can both inform evidence-based policy design (by revealing place-based challenges and proposing solutions) and support policy mechanisms that promote integration between state and non-state actors (by clarifying actor rights, roles and responsibilities). Co-developing a theory of change for integrated landscape management is inherently context specific, but the process and outcomes of this study should hold relevance across a range of contexts faced with sustainability challenges related to reconciling both conservation and development objectives. © 2022, The Author(s).","Conservation and development trade-offs; Environmental governance; Knowledge co-production; Natural resource management; Sustainability science; Transdisciplinarity",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137931807

The electrification rates ambition has triggered a policy trilemma. There are targets for meeting national energy demand; there are equally important targets for improving energy access and minimizing negative impacts on the environment. Purpose: This article illustrates idea contestation within Indonesia's rural electricity policy subsystem by: (1) analysing the position of the global sustainability storyline in pre- and post-SDG and Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) periods; and (2) exploring the dynamic of coalition structure within both periods. Methods and approach: The data is derived from statements of political actors in the national news articles and is analysed using Discourse Network Analysis. To investigate the influence of global agendas, we perform a timeframe analysis in pre- and post-SDG and NDC periods. Findings: Our analysis presented empirical evidence of the energy trilemma. The contestation between energy access, energy security, and climate change mitigation is observed in the ideas that emerged within the existing storylines. We find that sustainability has not been a primary topic of debate within the policy subsystem in pre- and post-SDG and NDC periods. The findings also reveal how the global deployment of sustainability has triggered the emergence of discursive intermediaries within the policy subsystem. They are essential to framing global environmental issues to fit into internal debates. Policy implications: First, the narration of implementing renewable energy has to emphasize its benefits over the energy poverty problem while injecting some messages related to environmental profit. Second, the issue of decentralization has always been the most frequent and mutually connected topic, both in terms of source utilization and governance.

Given the high irrigation demand and population, groundwater sustainability requires an improved understanding of groundwater systems for the accurate prediction of groundwater levels (GWLs). However, the prediction of groundwater system behaviors is a significant challenge since it is dominated by spatiotemporal and subsurface depth-dependent drivers. Earlier studies that address the challenges are mainly based on the short spatial and temporal extent and/or do not separate the renewable (i.e., shallow) vs nonrenewable (i.e., deeper) groundwater signals. Here, we first identified the variable importance of spatial and depth-dependent drivers on GWL in the IGBM basin. Our results indicate a greater influence of anthropogenic factors (i.e., widespread pumping and increased population) in most parts of the IGBM basin, except in the precipitation-dominated basin of the Brahmaputra. Our next purpose was to delineate a multifactorial approach for GWL prediction using the two most used machine learning models (i.e., support vector machine and feed-forward neural network) in the literature. In general, the machine learning model outputs show a good match in comparison to the GWL from the observation wells (n = 2303 distributed across India and Bangladesh) with some limitations in areas with increased groundwater irrigation. We separately compared the results from shallow (<35 m) and deep (>35 m) observation wells, emphasizing the significance of deep groundwater pumping. Our approach highlights the importance of spatiotemporal to multidepth factors in GWL prediction and can be adopted in other parts of the globe to predict GWLs. ©","Driver dominance on groundwater quantity; Groundwater level prediction; Groundwater pumping; Indus-Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna aquifers; Machine learning; Shallow vs deep groundwater; South Asia",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137920984

Ordinary capabilities, a prominent classification advocated by capability scholars, allow a firm to perform its primary functional activities. Past research indicates that there are limits to the contributions of ordinary capabilities to firm performance, but largely has explored it via contingent effects in an industry context. We argue, however, that these limits also are a function of the development of market-supporting institutions. In this paper, we investigate the effect of capital market development – a key pillar of market-supporting institutions – on a firm’s use of two ordinary capabilities, operations and marketing. We trace the heterogeneity of this effect for two key firm resources, investments in R&D and financial slack, that are indicative of different strategies pursued by firms. We test our three-way interaction model using a sample of Indian firms over a twenty-year period of institutional reforms. Our findings contribute to integrating the organizational capability and institutional theory literature and advancing research on the sustainability of firm profits in emerging economies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Capital markets; Emerging economies; Firm performance; Ordinary capability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137907203

It examines the transmission pattern (i.e. the way in which network members react to each other) of the IFs network. Design/methodology/approach: Literature review and interview were adopted to identify the IFs. Then, with the data collected from the interview in China, the social network analysis and interpretive structure model were synergised to examine the chain reaction, driving and dependent powers, and hierarchical structure of the identified IFs. Findings: The results reveal that the cognition, institutional, financial and participation aspects are key barriers confronted by PPP sustainability, and the government plays a leading role in controlling factors causing sustainability-related problems in PPPs. Weak government leadership and institutional environment were identified as the most fundamental reasons triggering a chain of IFs, while project governance and management activities act as bridge nodes that play an intermediary role in the IFs network. Research limitations/implications: This research contributes to the literature on PPP governance by (1) bridging the literature gap through the development of CGF for explaining the governance of PPP sustainability with a holistic view that considers both macro environment and operational project processes; and (2) identifying the transmission pattern of IFs network which uncovers the underlying dynamics causing the unsustainable operation of PPPs. Practical implications: This research provides practitioners with a list of key checkpoints for preventing failure escalation, enables decision-makers to prioritise obstacle-mitigation efforts and develop a feasible process to control PPP operation, and offers management countermeasures to remove the key barriers impeding PPP sustainability. Originality/value: This study is novel for adopting network-oriented techniques to quantify the relative importance of the IFs and examine the transmission pattern of the IFs system. Therefore, it visualises the complex underlying dynamics causing unsustainable PPP operation, identifies root and direct causes of PPP failures, and provides decision-makers with insights into sustaining PPP sustainability from a network-oriented perspective. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Collaborative governance; Interpretive structure model; PPPs; Social network analysis; Sustainable operation","Decision making; Internet protocols; Process control; Collaborative governances; Decision makers; Impeding factors; Interpretive structure model; Network oriented; PPP; Social Network Analysis; Structure models; Sustainable operations; Underlying dynamics; Sustainable development",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137903356

This is expected to change as civil society activism and new legislation increase the risk of litigation and reputational damage to supply chain partners. To deal with and combat modern slavery in the supply chain, a theory inspired social supply chain management framework consisting of indicators and countermeasures of modern slavery in the supply chain is developed. The framework is refined in a qualitative expert interview study. The theoretical framework is then evaluated by a multimethod empirical analysis that includes a multicase study based on publicly available supply chain data from 6000 media articles and company websites as well as a quantitative empirical study based on survey data from 280 corporate sustainability experts operating in global supply networks. The results show that economic, political-legal, social, and environmental factors have a significant impact on contemporary slavery in the supply chain. The study also motivates supply chain partners to use preventative and detective measures to reduce the probability of encountering modern slavery actions in their supply chain. Theoretical and managerial implications are drawn from the findings, pointing to a holistic approach to combatting modern slavery in the supply chain. © 2022 The Authors.

In particular, little is known about members' experiences in face-to-face peer led CSHGs. This systematic review aims to synthesise qualitative studies documenting personal experiences of CSHG members and to enlighten group processes and mechanisms. It focuses on benefits and challenges of participating in face-to-face CSHGs in studies based on qualitative research. Methods: MEDLINE, PsycINFO and PSYNDEX were used to identify relevant studies published from January 2000 to April 2022. Results: Of the 978 studies screened for eligibility, 20 studies were included in the review and were methodologically assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. All included studies consistently indicate that participation in a peer led CSHG leads to multiple perceived benefits, that is, informational support, shared experience, learning from others, helping others as well as cultivating humour as a coping strategy. Additionally, various challenges in CSHGs were identified, that is, confrontation with the suffering of others, divergent information needs, distressing group dynamics and challenging aspects concerning leadership and sustainability. Conclusion: This indicates that groups need low-threshold offers to be able to organise support in case of need. © 2022 The Authors.

All other preservation aspects, thermal or non-thermal, contribute to food preservation as per their specific functionality. From the given set of available food preservation technologies, shelf life extension by way of isochoric freezing works very well to extend the shelf life of fresh agricultural produce, without any weight loss and browning reaction to occur. Similarly, isochoric freezing of spinach tends to retain the amount of ascorbic acid and phenolic compounds in it. On the other hand, preservation by conventional freezing results in weight loss, flavor, and odor degradation, for example in fish. The isochoric method act as panacea for such types of problems faced during storage. This method works on to the key element wherein maintenance of intracellular osmolarity prevent the passing of solute concentration gradients across bind and free space inside the food. Practical Applications: This emerging novel processing of foods is applicable for fruits and vegetables to preserve them with minimal fresh harvest produce loss. Isochoric processing is done at a sub-zero temperature, which keeps the food fresh longer. This sustainability will lead to the minimization of price fluctuation and will also addresses food safety and security, minimize post-harvest losses, and enhance market appealability. This process has also revealed its potential among poultry and other meat products with enhanced keeping qualities. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",,"Ascorbic acid; Flavor compounds; Food preservation; Food storage; Browning reactions; Extended shelf lives; Literature survey; Nonthermal; Physicochemical influences; Preservation technologies; Shelf life extensions; Thermal; Weight loss; Freezing",Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137901021

Among several hydrological processes, lake water level (LWL) forecasting is one of the significant processes within a particular catchment. The complexity of the LWL fluctuation is owing to the diversity of the influential parameters including climate, hydrology and some other morphology. In this study, several versions of neurocomputing intelligence models are developed for LWL fluctuation forecasting at five great lakes Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario, located at the north of USA. The applied models are including M5-Tree, multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) and least square support vector regression (LSSVR). The models are developed using several input combinations that are configured based on the correlated lags in addition to the periodicity of time series. The sequential influence of the lakes order is considered in the modeling development. Also, cross-station modeling where lag time series of upstream lakes are used to forecast downstream LWL. Results are assessed using several statistical metrics and graphical visualization. Overall, the results indicated that the applied forecasting models efficient and trustworthy.

However, safety issues derived from battery thermal runaway remain a prominent challenge. In this work, a bi-continuous separator (Bi-Sep) via micro-gravure and phase inversion techniques is developed. The proposed nonshrinkage separator exhibits a nanoporous morphology and a super-stretchable property, thus effectively blocking both internal short circuits and chemical crosstalk between electrodes at thermal abusive temperatures. Besides its considerable performance at normal conditions, the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2/graphite pouch cell assembled with the Bi-Sep separator presents superior sustainability at an elevated temperature of 60 °C. Moreover, the cell using this Bi-Sep separator achieves an extremely high level of survivability under thermal abusive conditions. This work concludes that engineering the porous structure and thermomechanical properties of a separator, rather than simply improving its heat-resistance, is of significant importance for the development of safe batteries. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","battery safety; bi-continuous separators; chemical crosstalk; internal short circuits; thermal runaway","Crosstalk; Electrolytes; Heat resistance; Lithium-ion batteries; Safety engineering; Sustainable development; Timing circuits; Battery safety; Bi-continuous separator; Chemical crosstalk; Internal short circuit; Internal shorts; Nanoporous morphologies; Phase inversion techniques; Safety issues; Thermal; Thermal runaways; Separators",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137895625

We specify a mechanism that links aid programmes through (1) short-term and (2) medium-term improvements in basic services and (3) subjective progress to (4) perceptions of the state and spell four conditions (quality, sustainability, magnitude and attribution to the state) that must be met for this process to occur. We use this framework to evaluate a large-scale reconstruction programme in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). We find that the programme improved basic services in the short term and midterm and positively affected beneficiaries' subjective well-being. However, we do not find evidence that aid benefits have translated into political trust towards state institutions—on the contrary, project villages display slightly more negative attitudes than control villages. We suggest that this is due to lack of attribution of the improvements to the state that which was included in the selection phase but largely absent in the implementation.

Several elegant methods have been developed that offer the facile transformation of usually inert Csp2-H bonds to Csp2-Csp2 bonds in a single synthetic operation. Despite many merits, a major drawback to this chemistry comes from aryl-C-H bonds' low reactivity, which often mandate harsh reaction conditions compromising sustainability.

Customers do not perceive these platforms valuable if they do not experience adequate levels of quality and security from both the platform and applications (apps) they use. Therefore, the IoT platform provider as well as app developers need to go beyond collaboration and cocreate quality and security for each app on the platform. In this setting, we study the dynamics of the financial sustainability of the platform provider and app developers and find that the collaborative nature of the IoT platform has a significant role in the behavior and profitability of all parties. Specifically, a neutral entrant to the platform not only increases the effort levels of all existing parties, but also increases the profits due to network effects that are intertwined with economies of scale. We further find that a substantial number of apps are needed in the platform for an economically viable platform and that a less efficient platform leader needs even a larger application base. However, based on the number of apps on the platform and which party is more effective in the collaboration, the platform provider might need to provide additional incentives, or sometimes, extract additional rent from the app developers to financially sustain the platform. Furthermore, we verify our results in the presence of competition or complementarity among apps and further derive additional interesting results and managerial insights. For example, we find that the entry of a competing app may be beneficial for existing apps under some conditions. © 2022 Production and Operations Management Society.","collaboration; differential game; IoT platform; quality improvement; security improvement",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137885508

This paper explores the implications of a changing climate for the global tourism business and its intertwining global aviation industry that operates in a self-regulatory environment. Adopting a bibliometric analysis of the literature in the domain of global tourism and climate change (772 articles), the paper reveals the underlying sustainability issues that entail unsustainable energy consumption. The aviation industry as a significant source of carbon emission within the sector is then examined by analyzing the top 20 largest commercial airlines in the world with respect to its ongoing mitigating measures in meeting the Paris Agreement targets. While self-regulatory initiatives are taken to adopt Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) as alternative fuel production and consumption for drastically reducing carbon emission, voluntary alignment and commitment to long-term targets remain inconsistent. A concerted strategic approach to building up complementary sustainable infrastructures among the global network of airports based in various international tourist destination cities to enable a measurable reduction in carbon emission is necessary to achieve a transformational adaptation of a business sector that is of essence to the recovery of the global economy while attempting to tackle climate change in a post-COVID-19 era. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Aviation industry; Climate change; Energy sustainability; International airports; Paris agreement; Self-regulation; Tourism business",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137881227

The framework developed comprises four dimensions of sustainability structured from the literature review. Primary data were collected from 20 coffee farms selected from the most producing communities in the Planalto de Vitória da Conquista locality, sited in Centro-Sul Baiano middle region at the Bahia state. The main environmental issues identified related to coffee farmers are inadequate management of water consumption, influenced by the lack of knowledge about irrigation techniques in some cases, and the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. The economic evaluation of the activity revealed a low index of producers belonging to a class organization. In social aspects the issues are low level of technical/technological instruction for coffee producers, temporary workers are often used, the old age of most producers, the lack of family succession for the activity, low incomes, the high number of temporary workers, and the absence of the worker gains. As for the technical dimension, only half of the farmers invest in innovation, which causes high obsolescence of their equipment and machinery and a low participation rate in training courses. In the environmental dimension, the farmers return the packages of pesticides to the stores where they bought them. In the technical dimension, most farmers perform soil analysis. Besides addressing the identified challenges, the initiatives can help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, especially the 9th, 12th, and 13th. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Agriculture; Economic; Environmental; Framework; Social; Sustainable production; Technical",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137871123

Yet, how to finance the investment need to build a strong water sector for sustainability is a practical question that has been gaining wide attention globally. This paper synthesizes current knowledge and understanding of water investment finance. It examines and characterizes water finance and challenges, encompassing economics and practice of financing water investment needs, the commonly considered finance model, and barriers for water finance in relation to the unique features of water investment needs and the water sector. It introduces some promising practices adopted or advocated to address the financing challenges, and highlights key governance and institutional strategies to help bridge the funding gap in the water sector. Based on the synthesis, the paper offers some discussion on the water finance issue in the end.

Physicochemical properties (acidity, TSS, and pH), bioactive compounds (total phenolic and flavonoid compounds, lycopene, and citrulline), antioxidant potential (DPPH and FRAP) and microbiological analysis of watermelon fruit butter were evaluated for 60 days of storage at 4 ± 1°C. No significant (p >.05) changes in TSS whereas there was a drop in acidity and a rise in pH were observed in all treatments. As compared to other treatments, WMR extract preserved more (p <.05) color attributes, total phenolic and flavonoid compounds, lycopene, citrulline, and antioxidant activity of fruit butter during storage. The results regarding microbiological analysis indicated that the more (p <.05) microbial safety and longer shelf life were achieved by the 6% WMR extract incorporating fruit butter. The WMR addition in the form of extracts in the development of fruit butter was more effective in minimizing quality changes, retaining color, bioactive compounds, and reducing microbial growth during storage. Novelty impact statement: Our study focused on utilizing the nutritious watermelon rind (WMR) in different forms such as pulp, powder, and extract for the development of shelf-life-stable watermelon fruit butter. 6% WMR extract incorporating fruit butter ensures safety and quality, significantly high acceptability, and protects more nutrients by reducing microbial load as compared to other treatments. The conversion of such high-value agro-waste to design and develop innovative functional foods, bioactive, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceuticals could minimize food losses and waste, reduce environmental impact, maximize agricultural profit, and improve food sustainability on commercial scale.

When mod4 elling an optimisation problem, it should be clear that people do not make decisions in a vacuum or in isolation from the reality. So, there is always a decision-making context that, in addition to the <italic>natural</italic> constraints of the problem, acts as a filter on the candidate solutions available. If this fact is omitted, optimal but useless solutions to the problem can be obtained. In this paper, we propose a systematic way of modelling contexts based on fuzzy propositions and two approaches (<italic>a priori and a posteriori</italic>) for solving optimisation problems under their influence. In the proposed a priori approach, the context is explicitly included in the mathematical model of the problem. As this approach may have a limited application due to the increasing number of constraints and their nature, an <italic>a posteriori</italic> approach is proposed, in which a set of solutions, obtained by any means (like exact algorithms, simulation or metaheuristics), are checked for their suitability to the context by using a multi-criteria decision-making methodology.

Thus, an appraisal of their possible destructive air blast should be considered during the risk assessments. However, much less is known about how avalanche-induced air blasts occur and how destructive they are. Here an existing DEM-CFD coupled method was innovatively employed to quantitatively analyze the initiation and propagation mechanism of the air blast caused by the largest ice-rock avalanche during Nepal’s 2015 Gorkha earthquake, and compared the results with some recorded events. Our results highlighted the contribution of valley morphology to air blast generation. Large high-velocity ice/rock avalanches that have an airborne trajectory or a travel path with turning points can suddenly release tremendous energy and more probably cause destructive air blasts. Additionally, the Langtang air blast presented a propagation of 1 km from the avalanche impact point and equivalent destruction to an EF2–EF5 tornado, causing mass casualties. The large impact region and destructive force of avalanche-induced air blasts suggests their disastrous consequences that should provoke assessment of such type of cascading effect during the landslide risk assessment, especially for the long-term sustainability of planned infrastructure in high-altitude regions. © 2022, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Air blast; DEM-CFD coupled modeling; Disaster-causing mechanism; Ice/rock avalanche","Air; Earthquakes; Ice; Air blast; Coupled method; Coupled models; DEM-CFD coupled modeling; Disaster-causing mechanism; Ice-rock avalanches; Initiation and propagation; Initiation mechanism; Risks assessments; Run outs; Risk assessment",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137864021

SiO2 nanoparticles with KOH activation embedded in a carbon scaffold with a high surface area were highly activated to sodiation reaction, enabling a high-rate capability and long cycling performance, especially after the second cycle. The composite anode C/SiO2 could deliver a good initial capacity of 450 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.05 A g−1. Moreover, full-cell Na3V2(PO4)3 /C/SiO2 showed the first discharge capacity of 125 mAh g−1 at C/10. In detail, EIS and SEM ex situ methods were used to study the effect of SEI layer formation in the initial cycle and explore the electrochemical reactions in the cell system. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","anode material; C/SiO2; KOH activation; Na-ion battery; Rice husks","Anodes; Cathodes; Chemical activation; Electric discharges; Metal ions; Potassium hydroxide; Silica nanoparticles; Silicon; SiO2 nanoparticles; Sodium compounds; Anode material; C/SiO2; Energy storage and conversions; Future energies; High-performance anodes; KOH activation; Na-ion batteries; Rice husk; Sodium ion batteries; Sustainability issues; Sodium-ion batteries",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137855633

Even though HMF synthesis holds promise for a greener future, the current state of technology and the high production cost limit its competitiveness on an industrial scale. In this prospect, we have developed a multigram-scale procedure for HMF by reacting d-fructose with Purolite CT275DR an acidic resin in a dimethyl carbonate (DMC)/tetraethyl ammonium bromide (TEAB) biphasic system.

Among all the factors in traffic crashes, aggressive driving in which the driver usually makes excessive lane changes to overtake other vehicles is prevalent. As such, monitoring lane changes and providing real-time warnings is beneficial for improving transportation sustainability. This article presents BackWatch, a novel vehicle-mounted sensing system that uses a back view cabin camera monitoring the steering wheel rotations to track lane-change events. BackWatch consists of an encoder network to extract essential visual features of steering wheel rotations, and an inference network incorporating the visual and GPS speed features to recognize the resulting lane changes. Our system does not rely on precise coordinate alignment between the monitoring device and the vehicle, nor the wearables worn by the driver, and is robust against different drivers, vehicles, driving speeds, and environmental settings. We evaluate the system based on 16 hours of real-world on-road driving data collected from three pairs of cars and drivers under different traffic and environmental conditions. The results show that BackWatch achieves 0.952 of precision and 0.981 of recall on the detection of lane changes.

Therefore, the current research aimed to find new and safe agricultural practices to solve, partially at least, the issues of broomrape in faba bean fields. The experiment was conducted for two winter seasons of 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 in naturally infested field with broomrape. Treatments involved application of mycorrhiza, charcoal and rocket salad powder, glyphosate–isopropylammonium herbicide, and weedy check applied whether with sole planting of faba bean and interplanting with flax. The experiment was designed in a strip plot based on completely randomized block arrangement with six replicates. Broomrape number and weight, infested faba bean plants, faba bean agronomic traits, and seed nutrient uptake were estimated. In both seasons, glyphosate whether with sole or interplanting patterns recorded the lowest values of broomrape number plot‒1 and broomrape weight plot‒1 without significant variation with charcoal and rocket salad applied in interplanted plots. The maximum increases in faba bean seed yield were observed with application of charcoal × sole or interplanting pattern and rocket salad × interplanting pattern in the 2018/2019 season as well as charcoal, mycorrhiza, and rocket salad with sole pattern in the 2019/2020 season. Charcoal, mycorrhiza, and rocket salad were effective practices whether under sole or interplanting patterns for improving nutrient uptake, especially in the first season. In the second season, rocket salad with sole or interplanting pattern was the stable interaction for enhancing all nutrient uptake. Reducing broomrape hazards expressed in low number and weight with less infested faba bean plants was confined by application of mycorrhiza, charcoal, and rocket salad powder whether with sole planting of faba bean and interplanting with flax. Hence, faba bean farmers are advised to apply such promising safe practices for sustaining faba bean cultivation in lands infested by broomrape. © 2022, The Author(s).","Faba bean sustainability; Legume crops; Orobanche spp; Root parasitic weeds; Safe weed control",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137849079

The use of sustainable approaches, e.g., nanotechnology, for the removal of dyes is gaining more popularity nowadays. Nickel nanoparticles (an eco-friendly adsorbent) using Psidium guajava peels extract were synthesized to degrade reactive Orange E3 dye. Nickel nanoparticles (Ni NPs) were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopic techniques. The applications of synthesized Ni NPs in the degradation of reactive Orange E3 dye were studied using the effects of dye concentration, a catalyst with and without H2O2, pH, and temperature. The maximum decolorization (82.56%) was acquired at 0.01% color conc., 5 mg/L conc. of Ni-NPs, and pH 5 at 60 °C. The decrease in % reduction in COD and TOC was found to be 86.6% and 85.3%, respectively. The currently studied sustainable approach was found to be effective for the maximal removal of target dye. So, it is suggested that other toxic dyes could be easily eliminated using nanoparticles synthesized using a sustainable nano-technological approach. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University.","Characterization; Decolorization; Mineralization; Ni NPs; Orange E3 dye; Psidium guajava; Sustainability","Citrus fruits; Dyes; Effluents; Nanoparticles; Nickel; Sewage; Stripping (dyes); Synthesis (chemical); Textile industry; Bioactive compounds; Characterization; Decolourization; Mineralisation; Nickel nanoparticles; Orange e3 dye; Psidium guajava; Reactive dyes; Reactive orange; Synthesised; Sustainable development",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137842444

By applying a high salinity strategy, this study provides a prompt approach for removing high ammonia levels and relieving its adverse impacts on common carp. The study investigated five groups with triplicates where the control was kept with fresh water, and the remaining four groups stressed with different salinity levels (5, 10, 15, and 20 ppt) for 8 weeks. Then fish were exposed to unionized ammonia (NH3) stress (0.5 ppm) for 6 h. The final weight (FBW) and weight gain (WG) showed lower values in fish stressed with 15 and 20 ppt salinity levels than fish reared in 0 and 5 ppt salinity levels (p &lt; 0.05). The lowest FBW and WG and the highest feed conversion ratio were shown in fish grown in 20 ppt (p &lt; 0.05). The survival rate was markedly lowered by 15 and 20 ppt salinity levels (p &lt; 0.05), while no significant differences were observed among 0, 5, and 10 ppt salinity levels (p &gt; 0.05). Liver condition-related indices (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase) were markedly increased in fish grown in 15 and 20 ppt before or after ammonia stress (p &lt; 0.05). The results showed higher creatinine levels in fish raised in 15 and 20 ppt than the remaining salinity levels, with the highest value in fish of 20 ppt salinity before and after ammonia stress (p &lt; 0.05). Markedly the blood glucose and cortisol levels were upraised in fish reared in 10, 15, and 20 ppt before and after ammonia stress (p &lt; 0.05). The glucose level was not significantly different in fish reared in 5 ppt than 0 and 10 ppt salinity levels (p &lt; 0.05). Generally, the blood glucose and cortisol levels were decreased markedly after ammonia stress than before ammonia stress (p &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, total protein, albumin, and globulin levels were increased in common carp reared in different salinity levels after ammonia stress (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, ammonia toxicity combined with high salinity resulted in a regulatory effect on the hepato-renal function and stress-related markers in common carp. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","ammonia; blood health; carp; hypersalinity; sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137836615

Sustainability standards (SS) are essential tools for transnational trade governance because they increase the possibility of recognizing products from sustainable sources. However, there is currently a proliferation of SS in almost every industry. This paper proposes a conceptual framework to establish how standard interactions such as competition, cooperation, and overlap shape the impact of multiplicity on trade costs. We apply the framework to the palm oil industry by using the information on three aspects of SS schemes: the requirements, the institutional design, and the cooperation strategies. Our results indicate that the North–South multiplicity in the palm oil market is characterized by high overlap, but there exists a balanced co-opetition in the standard market. As the cooperation strategies between the SS schemes are very shallow, there might be potential trade costs associated with the SS multiplicity in the palm oil industry.

It is used to achieve a number of important objectives ranging from sustainability, public health, community and economic development. Despite the common use of this catch-all phrase, there are inconsistencies in its definition, underlying assumptions and objectives, its shaping of planning policy and the instruments used to measure its successful implementation. This paper provides a comparative international overview of the ways in which these more broadly-framed local living policies have been framed, and how they have been incorporated into strategic metropolitan plans for Australia’s capital cities. It is evident that approaches differ greatly, in terms of policy aims, objectives, their relationships to planning practice and other sectors and measures used to assess the success of implementation. The paper examines the salient differences and commonalities in these methodologies with a discussion of their implications for policy and research within varying socio-cultural and spatial contexts. It concludes with a discussion of the need for more specific and target-oriented strategies to overcome the implementation challenges in countries with car-dominated cities such as Australia. © 2022 Editorial Board, Urban Policy and Research.","Local living; proximity; sustainable mobility; transport and land use; travel time",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137826410

It is much bigger for the countries that are densely populated and are witnessing continued increase in the demand of motorized vehicles. Transportation accounts for a wide range of environmental impact across the globe. Electric vehicles in this context are recognised as a promising green alternative to traditional gasoline vehicles, for reducing the dependency on crude oil, consumption of energy and emissions of greenhouse gases from the transport sector. Talking about countries like India, currently electric vehicles comprise less than 1% of the overall automotive market share. The Indian Government is encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles through several schemes and policies but the results are yet to be seen. The purpose of this study is to analyse the relationships between the major drivers that would support the adoption of the electric vehicles in India using Interpretive Structural Modeling Technique. MICMAC Analysis is also used in order to study the dependency and mutual relationship between the drivers. The results unveil that the Government Policies and Initiatives and the Technological Advancements could be the key drivers in accelerating the adoption process. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","Drivers for adoption; Electric mobility; Electric vehicles; India; Interpretive structural modeling; Sustainable transportation","Competition; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Petroleum transportation; Sustainable development; Consumption of energy; Driver for adoption; Electric mobility; Environmental sustainability; Gasoline vehicle; India; Interpretive structural models; Motorized vehicles; Oil consumption; Sustainable transportation; Electric vehicles",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137821556

However, a pertinent use and control of its processing route and parameters need to be looked into for effective sustainability of the industries and resources involved. The application of Mechanical activation (MA) in the extractive metallurgical process (hydrometallurgy) has vehemently improved the conversion of waste to wealth compared to other pretreatment methods. Some industrial wastes are hazardous and they are heap-dumped, negatively influencing the environment they occupied. This present work reviewed the hazardous industrial solid wastes (HISWs) from which economically valuable metals (EVMs) were recovered and the economic and environmental benefits of recovering via the Mechanical Activation Hydrometallurgical process. The influence of both MA and leaching parameters on the recovery efficiency was shown. The detailed analysis of the optimum conditions of these MA-leaching processes was also reported on the ground of critical evaluation of the scientific literature scrutiny. This study aims to present a direction and guidance flow sheet based on an extensive literature survey for effective recovery of EVM from secondary resources (HISW) via the MA-hydrometallurgical process addressing the drawbacks of MA-assisted leaching.

FCA and ACFS are metallurgical waste materials from the ferrochrome industry, which contain residual chromium and face disposal problems. The leaching of chromium from FCA is reported to be 26 times more than the regulatory limit, as such banned for landfilling. The sustainable management of these metal residues in concrete making through the combined use of FCA (up to 40%) and ACFS (100%) for part replacement of the cement and total replacement of virgin coarse aggregate was examined. The technical performance of such concrete when examined in terms of compressive strength, modulus of rupture, and sulfate resistance has better performances up to 11% than conventional concrete. Environmental performances when examined through global warming potential (GWP), ozone depletion potential (ODP), abiotic depletion potential (ADP), photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP), eutrophication potential (EP), and acidification potential (AP) have advantages up to 47% when compared to normal concrete. The leaching of hexavalent chromium from such concrete is far below the regulatory limit. The economic performance of such concrete is found 22% cheaper than normal concrete.

Methods: The published data on SCT in T1D were retrieved from Elsevier’s Scopus database and analyzed using select bibliometric tools. We used VOSviewer software and the Biblioshiny app to construct and visualize bibliometric networks. Results: The global yield totaled 1806 publications in the 22-year study period, registering a 17.7% annual growth peaking at 196.9% in the last 11 years. The average citations per publication (CPP) decreased from 62.0 during 1999–2009 to 24.3 during 2010–2020. The funded publications were 727 (40.2%). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were only 2.4% (45). Amongst 70 participating countries, the USA led with a 38.6% share. Of the 388 global organizations, Harvard Medical School, USA, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Italy, and the University of Florida, USA were the topmost contributors.

Integrating road and rail systems, known as intermodal transportation, contributes to a sustainable business environment. In this article, based on a sequential game, an integrated multi-level intermodal network design problem (IMINDP) is addressed. On the upper level, a government as the Stackelberg leader with environmental, economic, and social concerns decides whether or not to establish intermodal terminals and rail corridors, considering budget limitation and minimization of both internal and external costs. On the lower level, freight shippers as the Stackelberg followers decide how to transport their freight shipments through rail, road, and intermodal networks, considering rail accessibility, capacity constraints and internal costs minimization. A mathematical programming model is developed to formulate the shippers’ best response to the decisions adopted by the government. Due to NP-hard nature of the problem, a three-level solution approach, based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and novel heuristic indicators, is proposed. An exhaustive enumeration algorithm is presented to achieve the optimal solutions as benchmarks for evaluating the solutions obtained by the proposed solution approach. An experimental analysis based on a real-world case indicates the great efficiency of the proposed solution approach. According to the results, a decrease in available budget of infrastructure construction leads to an increase in total external and internal costs imposed on the government. It is also inferred that external transportation costs internalization, as an effective pricing policy, plays a significant role in the strategic network design decisions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Intermodal transportation; Modal competition; Networks; Sequential game; Sustainability","Budget control; Costs; Freight transportation; Genetic algorithms; Intermodal transportation; Mathematical programming; Railroad transportation; Roads and streets; Ships; Internal costs; Modal competition; Multilevels; Network; Network design problems; Rail transportation; Sequential games; Solution approach; Stackelberg; Transportation system; Sustainable development",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137795906

Sustainability of construction projects can only be achieved when the sustainability in economic, social and environmental dimensions are adequately addressed. It is therefore important to develop an effective model for understanding dynamic sustainability of construction projects with coordination perspective incorporated. In this paper, the dynamic sustainability assessment model of construction projects is proposed by adopting system dynamic and coupling coordination degree methods collectively, and the weighting values between dimensions are assigned from coordination perspective. The sustainability of a construction project is measured not only by the total value of sustainability in all dimensions, but also the coordination of sustainability between various dimensions. Moreover, according to the assessment results, an adjustment procedure is designed for simulating the formulation process of improvement strategy. The effectiveness of the developed sustainability assessment model is demonstrated with its application in three scenarios based on a case study. The results of case demonstration show that the overall sustainability value of case project is 0.63, and this value can be increased to 0.69 when effective strategies are adopted. Sustainability of the case project in environmental and social dimensions at operation and demolition stages should be enhanced. In applying the assessment model, dynamic sustainability of construction projects can be properly realized by project managers, and therefore proposing effective strategies to improve their sustainability and raise long-term value.

We posit that a long-term ownership horizon is an enabling but not sufficient condition for sustainability and propose owner stewardship as an important contingency. Research Findings/Insights: We review 161 articles on the relationship between corporate ownership and sustainability/CSR, published during 2017–2021 and not covered by previous reviews. We find (1) in most cases, a positive effect of institutional ownership on sustainability, particularly for long-term institutional investors; (2) in most cases, a positive effect of state ownership, seen as long-term-oriented; and (3) mixed results regarding family ownership, also seen as long-term-oriented. We also observe considerable heterogeneity in how prior research defines and measures the key constructs of our review. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Long-term ownership appears to be an enabling but not sufficient condition for corporate sustainability, and stewardship at the ownership level may be an important missing link. Furthermore, the wide variety of terminology and measures in the literature poses a challenge for knowledge accumulation. Efforts towards convergence and standardization seem important. Practitioner/Policy Implications: An exclusive focus on short-termism may be misleading.

The 2030 Agenda has given a boost to the use of accounting practices to achieve Sustainable Developments Goals. While sustainability, together with accounting and accountability, has been explored, less attention has been paid to the antecedents leading to its embedding in public management practices. To provide a contribution on this matter, this study investigates the organizational processes facilitating public managers in institutionalizing sustainability, accounting and accountability practices. Focusing on the 11th Sustainable Development Goal, “cities” are entrusted with making cultural heritage management sustainable, raising the research question: what challenges does the 11th Sustainable Development Goal pose for the public management of urban cultural heritage? Action Research was carried out to investigate knowledge building within a project—the “Pavia Network Project” (2014–2017)—involving practitioners and researchers. The research findings shed light on the organizational processes that led to the implementation of sustainable accounting and accountability by an Italian smart city. The choice fell on Pavia because of its invaluable cultural heritage, having been, through time, the capital of the Early Medieval Lombard Kingdom, a wealthy Renaissance court and an historical university town. From the discussion of the results, a conceptual model on the antecedents of sustainable accounting and accountability knowledge arose. Besides the limitations of Action Research, this model suggests meaningful insights for both practitioners and researchers into the organizational changes triggered by the 2030 Agenda. © 2022, The Author(s).","Accounting and accountability; Action Research; Organizational learning process; Social connectedness; Sustainability; Urban cultural heritage",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137780709

This study also analyzes the obstacles in implementing the LS framework as incubation metrics. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses mixed methods. Quantitative research using multiple linear regression was applied to the data of 30 start-ups incubated at Bandung Techno Park for the 2014–2017 period and survival tracking data after the incubation. A qualitative approach to complete the explanatory work was conducted through in-depth interviews with 12 respondents, including start-up graduates from the incubation program, program managers and mentors. Findings: This study confirms that several LS incubation metrics significantly affect start-up sustainability after incubation. In addition, this study also explains several problems in applying the LS discipline that needs attention to increase incubation success. Research limitations/implications: Research was conducted only at one technology business incubator (TBI) model that focuses on digital start-ups in the emerging ecosystem. Research results can be biased in different situations and ecosystems. Practical implications: The explanation of the relationship of LS-based incubation metrics to the survival of start-ups, as well as the challenges of their implementation, can be a reference for TBI management to consider and prioritize intervention strategies, thereby improving TBI’s business processes and increasing the success rate of incubated start-ups. Social implications: The creation of university start-ups and spin-offs has become a key performance indicator mandatory for technology universities in Indonesia. The existence of TBI institutions in universities as channels of technology commercialization is essential. The incubator’s success in creating a new technology-based company will have a significant social impact on the surrounding environment. Originality/value: Although the LS method is popular in start-up communities and among practitioners, it is rarely used in the incubation process at universities. These results can be considered for university TBIs to explore LS as an incubation management tool to increase the success rate of incubated start-ups. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Incubation metrics; Lean start-up; Start-up; Survival; Technology business incubator",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137778126

The aim of this article is to investigate how an inter- and transdisciplinary setting in which students develop master theses can contribute to learning about a specific urban problem and what challenges this transdisciplinary education entails. Starting from relevant theoretical and analytical frameworks, such as Mode 2 Science (Nowotny et al. 2005) and the three-phase model of Lang et al.

To provide more in-depth and refined insights, we focus on an exemplary activity of the Stadsacademie: the Master Thesis Ateliers ‘Diversity in Social Housing’. A Master Thesis Atelier (MTA) is a collaborative trajectory of one academic year in which 4 to 8 master students and their supervisors from different disciplinary backgrounds concentrate on one specific urban problem and collaborate with non-academic actors aiming to explore and to impact upon that issue.

This viewpoint article argues that urban happiness associated with welfare, health, and quality of life is the gateway to transforming smart cities into sustainable living places. Firstly, happy cities share similar and vital characteristics with transitions, such as equity, justice, inclusion, and participation. Intelligent technologies would not benefit socio-technical systems without addressing these factors. Secondly, urban changes require years and decades to ferment. Planners and policymakers should concern about technologies’ long-term influence on well-being and urban liveability. Finally, technology innovation is a process of urban planning, not the destination. Thus, exploring whether cities’ “smart” input can effectively turn into consistent happiness is necessary. Given a lack of linkages between smart and happy cities in past studies, I propose conceptual metrics for evaluating happiness-driven and sustainability-led smart cities. My arguments also present several trains of thought to open more dialogues for researchers and urban planners. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Happy cities; smart cities; social sustainability; urban planning; well-being",,Note,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137769491

Employees and managers from tour companies in an Asia-Pacific market context provided the survey responses, which were put through structural equation analysis. The results revealed that tourism employees’ green role identity and green creative self-efficacy functioned as a dual mediation pathway to link customer green involvement to green creative behavior among tourism employees. Organizational green culture played a moderating role for the impacts of customer green involvement on employee green role identity and green creative self-efficacy.

This paper argues that knowledge and innovation management (KIM) can play a key role in fostering and managing creativity in the agribusiness sector. To test this assumption, an empirical model linking KIM with employee creativity, responsible green innovation, and performance in the agribusiness sector of the Dominican Republic is proposed and tested with data from 110 agribusiness companies. We found that strengthening the relationships between the above constructs is needed, with a view to readjusting the meaning of firm performance in the light of emerging (post-pandemic) circumstances for agribusinesses.

Nova Southeastern University’s South Florida Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program (NSU SFGWEP) has partnered with primary care clinics to provide AFHS training and support to promote AFHS transformation in Broward and Miami-Dade Counties. NSU SFGWEP provides face-to-face and virtual training for AFHS and Electronic Health Record (EHR) documentation as part of the initiative. This project focuses on a group of primary care clinics in Broward County, Florida. In this paper, we evaluate the progress of AFHS transformation through six e-clinical measures that collectively provide indicators of the 4 M framework of AFHS (What Matters, Medication, Mentation, and Mobility). We used provider feedback and e-clinical measures aligned with the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) to measure clinic outcomes. From Jan 1– Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 1–Dec 31, 2020, the clinics improved high-risk medication management (0–3.71%), advanced care planning (6.79%–20.74%), and fall risk assessment (no data- 46.72%).

In Aotearoa New Zealand (Aotearoa NZ), the operationalisation of EBM has been uneven; however, a set of principles to guide EBM in Aotearoa NZ provides a useful foundation to enable and enhance its uptake and to support governance approaches that attend to the rights, values, interests, and knowledges of Māori, the Indigenous peoples of Aotearoa. In acknowledging the need to give attention to the governance of marine environments, we apply insights from the ‘relational turn’ in social sciences and sustainability science to explore the ontological and epistemological broadening of ‘governance’ to identify opportunities for alternative forms of governance that accommodate Indigenous ways of knowing. We propose four pou (or enabling conditions) that generate alternatives to governance models underpinned by a ‘modernist’ (dualistic, technocratic) ontology: (i) enacting interactive administrative arrangements; (ii) diversifying knowledge production; (iii) prioritising equity, justice, and social difference; and (iv) recognising interconnections and interconnectedness. Our analysis of seven governance examples exposes evidence of radical and progressive transformations occurring within Aotearoa NZ regarding conceptions of the environment and the role of people in it that could support the wider uptake of EBM. Rather than advocating a ‘perfect model’ of governance for EBM, we find potential in EBM as a strategic approach to managing marine environments because of the synergies with Indigenous and relational ontologies, which lie in the emphasis on interconnectedness, inclusivity, diversity, and relationality. © 2022, The Author(s).","Aotearoa New Zealand; Ecosystem-based management; Governance; Indigenous ontologies; Māori; Relational ontologies",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137755987

Local appreciation of ecosystem services and knowledge of how the foundation of these services is affected by local livelihoods are important for the sustainability of natural resources and thus may fundamentally affect human well-being. In this study, we tested how student knowledge, attitudes and views towards ecosystem services and biodiversity changed due to an education programme. We assessed the before and after knowledge, attitudes, and views of 180 level-two secondary school students in the Ngorongoro District, Tanzania. Findings suggested an increased proportion of students could identify ecosystem services after the education programme, with increased knowledge of ecosystem services and their importance being attributed to developing understandings of negative outcomes caused by climate change, human population growth and land use change. The increased awareness of ecosystem services gained via the education programme suggests that education programmes can be an important tool in conservation biology. Therefore, we recommend that education programming dealing with threats to ecosystem services and biodiversity should be included in school curricula, especially for students close to protected areas. © 2022 The Author(s).

Their quality and the ecosystem services they provide depend on the integrity of their subterranean biota. However, current anthropogenic impacts such as climate change effects and coastal population growth place enormous pressure on the sustainability of these environments. Despite the significance of subterranean biota to ecosystem function and the delivery of ecosystem services, stygofauna—groundwater-dwelling aquatic animals—have until recently been largely ignored in aquifer monitoring and management. This issue is of importance in both coastal and inland zones. Common threats in inland and coastal areas are water extraction, reduced recharge caused by aridification, and pollution, while, in coastal zones, additional complications arise from sea-level change and salt water ingress. This review examines stygofaunal diversity, impacts, and future conservation challenges in coastal aquifers. Focussing on Australia, we provide a summary of the available data on stygofaunal communities and distributions; identify and describe potential threats to these communities across the diverse coastal regions of the continent; and propose future research priorities with the goal of facilitating the long-term preservation of these ecosystems on the Australian continent. While we focus this review on Australia, the threats and management issues discussed are relevant globally. Recent subterranean studies in Australia have been primarily undertaken in inland areas, and while coastal data exist, ecological assessment of coastal subterranean ecosystems is incomplete, compromising the efficacy of conservation plans. This review indicates that the Australian continent hosts five major coastal stygofaunal biodiversity areas characterised by heterogeneous community assemblages, involving a total of 17 taxonomic groups spanning microscopic aquatic invertebrates to vertebrates. The most relevant impacts and threats identified were aquifer size reduction, intrusion of seawater, land clearing, contamination, and mining. Given the projections of increasing coastal development and subsequent loss or degradation of habitat during coming decades, it is important to improve our limited understanding of the ecology of coastal aquifers. Future research should include the refinement of biological assessment tools for coastal systems, functional and ecotoxicological studies, and faunal surveys of urban coastal aquifers. The recommendations and guidelines outlined in this review are applicable globally and provide a further step toward the sustainable use of coastal groundwater resources and the maintenance of healthy groundwater ecosystems. © 2022 The Authors.

A series of observations and interviews were conducted to learn more about the ecotourism of rural development. The results showed two opposing views on the importance of the concept. It considerably improves perceptions of openness, ties-based local communities and resource preservation. On the other side, there are considerable obstacles to the tourist village’s effective sustainability, including corruption, local disbelief in the government, and a lack of ecotourism in planning initiatives.

Comparison of the control and new program statistical means (adjusted for period effects) were assessed with an F test. Results: Key workers reported increased confidence to talk to parents about their own wellbeing (d = 0.51, F(1, 51.8) = 4.28, p = 0.044) and knowledge of parental mental wellbeing improved (p = 0.006). A reduction in staff sick leave partially offset the cost of the intervention. Conclusions: A multi-pronged intervention targeted at key workers was found to be an effective way to ensure parental wellbeing is supported at an ECIS in Australia. Trial Registration: ACTRN12617001530314Implications for Rehabilitation There are implications for the development of children whose parents are experiencing high stress and poor mental health, whereby parents of children with disability or developmental delays are at increased risk. Findings from this study support the recommendation that a key worker is provided to holistically support families who access Early Childhood Intervention Services to aid in reducing poor parental wellbeing and child outcomes. Improved confidence to support and initiate conversations regarding parental wellbeing by key workers, in combination with support from management and the organisation to undertake this as part of their role, is a positive finding from this intervention study. © 2022 The Author(s).

While many peatlands in temperate regions such as Europe have been drained for centuries, those of Southeast Asia have mostly been drained for agriculture and forestry practices within the last 30 years. These areas are subsiding rapidly, but few long-term subsidence records exist, and it is unclear whether currently high subsidence rates will be maintained in future. Furthermore, large-scale climate fluctuations associated with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) exert a strong year-to-year influence on rainfall rates, affecting water table depth dynamics in both managed and intact peatlands. In this study, we analysed data collected over more than a decade of subsidence measurements from over 400 plantation and forest plots in Sumatra, Indonesia, including a unique set of 62 sites that have been continuously monitored since 2007. We show that spatial and temporal variations in subsidence rates are primarily determined by water table depth. We also find evidence of declining subsidence rates as a function of time since initial drainage, consistent with previous instrumental records from high-latitude peatlands and recent satellite data from tropical peatlands. Subsidence rates over the study period were strongly affected by the large ENSO/IOD-linked drought event in 2015–16, which caused an acceleration of subsidence across all sites. In plantation areas, we estimate that this climate perturbation caused around 14 % of subsidence observed over a twelve year period. At interior forest sites this rose to 32 %, and we found little evidence of ecosystem recovery to the end of 2018. This raises the possibility that repeated extreme droughts in the region could lead to long-term degradation of peat swamp forest ecosystems. © 2022 The Author(s)","Acacia plantation; El Nino; Peat swamp forest; Subsidence; Tropical peat; Water table","Atmospheric pressure; Climatology; Drought; Ecosystems; Forestry; Groundwater; Land use; Subsidence; Sustainable development; Timber; Tropics; Wetlands; Acacium plantation; EL Nino; El Nino southern oscillation; Indian Ocean dipole; Long-term trajectories; Peat land; Peat swamp forests; Tropical peat; Water table depths; Watertable; Peat",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137720216

Our study contains two parts: (i) a study of the firms’ external communication through their annual reports, sustainability reports and webpages, and (ii) a follow-up survey of the top management team. The survey contains quantitative questions and free text answers, which provide additional insights into the mapping and risk-handling of climate-related risks among the firms. We find that firms are likely to engage in some form of mapping and reporting of climate-related risks, but there are variations among the firms. Furthermore, the management of climate-related risks appears to be a residual issue for most firms with little active engagement from the management team or board of directors. Public policies and private initiatives, such as the EU’s Non-Financial Reporting Directive/Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (NFRD/CSRD), the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities, and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), may redirect and accelerate investments promoting a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy. Although most firms map and report climate-related risks, the understanding of the nature of these risks, of underlying problems, and of what a climate transition implies, varies across firms and industries. The success of the EU’s NFRD/CSRD, the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities, and TCFD requires an improved understanding of climate-related risks among the firms and a more proactive engagement of the management team. Policymakers must provide firms with additional guidance aimed at improving their understanding of climate-related risks and thus their capacity to manage these risks. Firms need to, individually and jointly, revise their theoretical and empirical understandings of climate-risk management and especially the role climate-related risks play in the new policy setting. The TCFD has an important role to play, but as a voluntary initiative, it is insufficient to generate change among all firms. © 2022 The Author(s).

Furthermore, developing capabilities is important to enable graduates to act in differing professional contexts. In response to these needs, this paper contextualises safety as part of sustainability in undergraduate engineering studies by exploring the complementarity between professional capabilities for safety in engineering and key capabilities found in sustainability education literature. The paper draws on findings from interviews with 41 pipeline engineers undertaken to build an understanding of differing views on engineering capabilities necessary for safety decision making. The results show synergies between safety and sustainability capabilities in the context of engineering practice and the opportunities to contextualise safety within sustainability in engineering education. From a safety perspective, given the expanding sustainable development agenda, there is an opportunity to increase education for public safety in engineering curricula within the scope of sustainability education and to shift learning from competencies to capabilities-based outcomes. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","capability; competence; Engineering curriculum; public safety; sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137711685

Climate emergency advocates demonstrate that rapid transformative action beyond ‘normal’ politics is needed to meet the Paris agreement targets. Critics, on the other hand, highlight the risks of deploying emergency frames to galvanize climate action, which may simply result in failed securitizations or even in emergency suspensions of democratic norms that advance climate action at the expense of climate justice. This paper will engage this debate by exploring the question: could climate emergency mobilizations be compatible with climate justice? I will argue, following Andreas Kalyvas, that the climate emergency can be framed as an opportunity for an ‘extraordinary politics’ of democratic constituent power, though this would involve risks and trade-offs that must be negotiated in practice. © 2022 The Author(s).

This paper focuses on understanding the various aspects of Electric Discharge Machining (EDM) that check its environmental friendliness and sustainability through a comprehensive literature review. This includes looking through the work related to bio-dielectrics as well as process parameters that compute energy consumption. The first section of this manuscript provides a succinct overview of using bio dielectric to make EDM more environmentally friendly. The review suggests that the problems of environmental pollution in the form of aerosol emission, unsustainability and cost of conventional EDM dielectric can be easily solved by using various bio-dielectrics. The second section focuses on reducing energy consumption by optimising electrical and non-electrical process parameters as well as by using various hybrid EDM. Recent scientific papers have been critically reviewed mentioning their significance and important contribution. EDM machining of some modern materials like hybrid Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs), ceramic and nanomaterial is also summarised.

Many individual pharmacists embrace these core values. However, their ability to honor these values is significantly determined by the nature of the system in which they work. The paper starts by presenting the prevailing pharmacist workforce model, the ‘Atomistic’ Model, in Scotland, in which core roles are typically separated into hierarchically disaggregated jobs focused on one professional ‘pillar’: Clinician/Practice Provider; Educator; Leader/Manager; and Researcher. This skills-segregation yields a workforce of individuals working in isolation rather than collaborating, lacking a shared purpose. Key strategic flaws include suboptimal responsiveness to population needs, inconsistency/inequity of care, erosion of professional agency, and lower job satisfaction. It is conjectured that this results from a lack of congruence between values, professional ethos, and organizational structure. ‘Atomism’ culminates in a syndrome of widespread professional-level cognitive dissonance. The paper contrasts this with an emerging workforce vision, the Collaborative Care Model. This new model defines a systems-first-approach, built on the principle that all jobs must include all four professional ‘pillars’. Vertical skills integration, involving education and task sharing, supports sustainability and succession planning. Horizontal skills integration (across practice, leadership/management, education, and research) is included to improve responsiveness to population need and individual professional agency. The working conditions, supportive ethos, and career structure needed to make the model work are described. Moral and workforce theory are used to justify why the model may be more effective for population health, delivering greater job satisfaction for individuals and ultimately helping systematically realize healthcare values. Finally, the paper sketches the first steps needed to implement the model at the national level, starting with the operationalization of new multi-‘pillar’ professional curricula across the career spectrum. Potential challenges also are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Pharmacists; Professionalism; Skills development; Values; Workforce",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137693739

However, the plan involves multi-dimensional uncertain factors and requires comprehensive optimization methods. This paper proposes a regionally integrated energy system (IES) optimization framework coupled with a sustainability assessment model. The four pillars of sustainability, considering technology, economy, environment, and society, are proposed to evaluate the sustainable performance of IES. Integrated the sustainability model of four pillars involving 11 indicators into the IES optimization, the optimal configurations and capacities of IES plants are obtained in an industrial park case. The combination of specialist questionnaires and numerical data of IES schemes demonstrates their weights of four pillars as 0.247, 0.227, 0.304, and 0.222, respectively. The optimal IES configurations under different solar installation area ratios are obtained, and their influences on energy planning are discussed. The solar heat collector is recommended to achieve the largest composite sustainability index, 0.458, when 20 % of the area is allowed for installation. The increasing capacity of photovoltaic panels with the increasing solar ratio is integrated into the IES to promote its sustainability. When the solar ratio reaches 80 %, the composite sustainability index is up to 0.634. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Composite sustainability index (CSI); Energy planning; Integrated energy system (IES); Optimization; Sustainability assessment","Fossil fuels; Industrial plants; Passive solar; Solar heating; Solar power generation; Surveys; Assessment models; Composite sustainability index; Energy planning; Energy system optimizations; Integrated energy system; Integrated energy systems; Optimisations; Optimization framework; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability index; Sustainable development",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137687683

To ensure sustainability in broiler production, poultry nutritionists continue to look for alternatives to AGP and antioxidants. Using herbal ingredients is one alternative that is widely used today. However, the use of herbal ingredients in small doses is often constrained by bioavailability problems, thereby reducing the effectiveness of using herbal additives for broiler chickens. At higher doses, the use of herbal ingredients can increase feed costs and negatively impact palatability, digestion and protein utilization, and liver health. Encapsulation is a method that can improve the stability, palatability, and bioavailability of herbal additives, which may enhance the efficacy of herbs as AGP and antioxidant alternatives for broilers.

Therefore, the performance of fibre-reinforced (FR) GMR pastes containing nanoparticles must be further explored. The goal of this study is to incorporate varying amounts of nano titanium dioxide (NTD) into micro carbon-FR fly ash-based GMR pastes to increase microstructure, impact strength, toughness, fracture, and mechanical performance. Four different dosages of NTD, ranging from 1 to 4% by the weight of the mix to cast GMR mixes including a constant dosage of micro carbon fibre (CF) (0.5% by weight of mix). A reference mix with 0.5% micro-CF having no dosage of NTD was also manufactured. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to assess the internal structure of GMR. The average findings of six specimens from each paste were taken to determine the different features of GMR pastes. The outcomes of this investigation revealed that using 3% NTD in a carbon-FR-GMR mix produced the best results in terms of hardness, impact strength, and compressive stress while using 2% NTD produced the best results in terms of flexural stress and fracture toughness of pastes. The compressive and flexural strengths of GMR improved by 23% and 40% while the impact strength and hardness were improved by 53% and 10%, respectively. © 2022 THE AUTHORS","Compressive strength; Fracture toughness; Geopolymer nanocomposite; Micro carbon fibres; Nano titanium dioxide","Compressive strength; Fly ash; Fracture toughness; Geopolymers; Hardness; Impact strength; Inorganic polymers; Reinforcement; Scanning electron microscopy; Sustainable development; Tensile strength; TiO2 nanoparticles; Titanium dioxide; Carbon fiber reinforced; Geopolymer; Geopolymer nanocomposite; Mechanical characteristics; Mechanical toughness; Micro carbon fiber; Micro-fiber; Microstructural characteristics; Nano-TiO 2; Nano-titanium dioxide; Carbon fibers",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137676289

Ozone depletion, the greenhouse effect, global climate changes, and global warming are among rising environmental concerns. During a recent climate change conference, i.e., COP 26 in Glasgow, UK, in November 2021, the Glasgow climate pact was unveiled to drive action across the globe on mitigation- reducing emissions; adaptation – helping those already affected by climate change, finance – enabling countries to deliver on their climate goals and collaboration- working together to deliver even more significant action. Libraries have not been left behind and are engaging in green initiatives to lessen global warming and safeguard the environment through the green library initiative (Singh & Mishra, 2019). Librarians are slowly becoming eco-conscious and developing the sense of creating libraries that minimize power consumption and become energy efficient and environmentally friendly to attain sustainable libraries or green libraries. There is limited research on green initiatives in libraries in Africa, although a lot is being done in some libraries to ensure environmental sustainability. A case study of academic libraries in Kenya was done to establish the perspectives of librarians on going green and levels of adoption while also exploring the motivations and barriers to environmental sustainability championed by libraries. Through purposive sampling, the study looked at ten academic libraries in Kenya that are perceived to be either partially or fully green. Head librarians of these institutions were taken through interviews to explore the adoption of green initiatives. Observation and document review were also used in the mixed methods case study. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Academic green libraries; Environment sustainability; Going green; Green libraries; Kenya",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137676283

But, due to a monotonic decline in catches over the last five years, it is essential to explore the current stock status concerning the removal rate to ensure the sustainability of this fishery. Therefore, given the reliability and minimal data requirements, this study employed an extended Bayesian State-Space Surplus Production Model, JABBA (Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment), to assess the stock rigorously. The results revealed that the stock biomass of the Pomfret fishery in the final year of the time series is significantly lower than BMSY, the biomass required to produce MSY. Consequently, this study recommends a yearly catch limit (TAC) of 10,000 metric tons to prevent further depletion of the stock biomass. Furthermore, to avoid growth overfishing by allowing all immature fishes to reproduce at least once before being caught, this study also calculated the optimum length (Lopt) for catch for both species at which biologically maximum yield and revenue can be obtained. The estimated Lopt is 25 cm for P. argenteus and 30 cm for P. chinensis, and not to capture fishes with lengths lower than these limits, this study further calculated the minimum mesh size limits for gill and set bag nets is 7.5 cm. Though the mesh size regulation was estimated using length-based reference points derived from an empirical equation, this regulation can be used as an associate reference point when TAC is applied to assure the sustainability of this fishery. © 2022 Shanghai Ocean University.","JABBA; Lower length limits for catches; Mesh size regulation; Pomfret fishery; Stock assessment; TAC",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137669387

To this aim, a theoretical framework is developed using the social norm, signalling and agency theories. Design/methodology/approach: A pooled logit regression model is applied on a sample of 2,541 firm-year observations collected from the most sustainable companies in Europe in the period between 2004 and 2015 to test the effect of religiosity on SRA adoption. Different analyses are used to check for the robustness of the findings and a generalized method of moments (GMM) is used to address potential endogeneity issues. Findings: The results of this study show that companies based in highly religious countries are more likely to adopt SRA practices to show compliance with the religious social norms of their stakeholders. The results also show that companies based in predominantly Roman Catholic countries are more likely to adopt SRA practices than those operating in Protestant countries. This may be due to the fact that the structural organization of Catholicism is based on a vertical, top-down control system, which does not foster trust and requires constant assurance. This explains the emphasis placed on SRA by stakeholders adhering to Catholicism. Stakeholders from Protestant countries, on the other hand, tend to rely more on the principles of social ethics and social mutual control that characterize their doctrine and, therefore, do not need any additional, external assurance of corporate commitment to sustainability.

However, the photocatalytic performance still suffers from critical charge recombination due to insufficient driving force. Herein, piezocatalysis and photocatalysis are judiciously combined to enable efficient piezo-photocatalytic activity, by synthesizing novel 1T/2H MoSe2/Bi2WO6 (1T/2H MS/BWO) and 2H MoSe2/Bi2WO6 (2H MS/BWO) hierarchical microspheres. The optimal 1T/2H MS/BWO piezo-photocatalyst exhibits excellent degradation activity of diclofenac (DCF) under the combined action of sunlight and ultrasound, achieving degradation efficiency of 99.9% in 60 min, which is significantly promoted than that of 2H MS/BWO and pure BWO. Piezoresponse force microscopy and ferroelectric analyzer results demonstrate that the 1T/2H MS/BWO composite generates a strong polarization electric field, which could act as powerful driving force to accelerate carriers separation and thus improve the piezo-photocatalytic activity. Moreover, several characterizations of 1T/2H MoSe2 and 2H MoSe2 reveal that the 1T/2H MoSe2 displayed larger surface area, better light absorption, more active sites and more favorable band position than 2H MoSe2. Finally, mechanism studies including degradation pathways and possible intermediates during DCF degradation were investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","1T/2H MoSe2; 2H MoSe2; Bi2WO6; Piezo-photocatalysis; Piezoelectric","Bismuth compounds; Density functional theory; Energy policy; Light absorption; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Microspheres; Photocatalytic activity; Piezoelectricity; Scanning probe microscopy; Selenium compounds; 1t/2h mose2; 2h mose2; Diclofenac; Driving forces; Energy crisis; Hierarchical microspheres; Photocatalytic activities; Photocatalytic performance; Piezo-photocatalyse; Piezoelectric; Degradation",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137652949

The need for building resilient supply chains to mitigate the effect of such disruptions is rising rapidly than ever before across the global business spectrum. Building resilience in the automotive spare parts (ASPs) supply chain is critically important as any disruption to automotive spares supply chain will affect the operations of the logistics sector, the backbone of global supply chains. This research work contributes to improving the resilience of the automotive spare parts supply chain by proposing a Viable Supply Chain (VSC) framework design that incorporates Additive Manufacturing (AM) enabled trucks in the automotive spares supply chain network. Based on the proposed model, conceptual case models are developed and tested with proposed AM enabled truck manufacturing closer to end customer. A heuristic approach called shortest time heuristic is also proposed to solve the routing and scheduling of an AM enabled truck to deliver customers’ orders of the spare parts through an online platform. Importantly, the study demonstrate how additive manufacturing can help the ASPs industry to switch from the existing practice of make-to-stock to a more efficient inventory management and cost saving make-to-order model while also achieving resilience and sustainability in by providing a source of spares support for discontinued models of vehicles. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Automotive spares; Online platform; Routing and Scheduling; Supply chain resilience; Viable supply chain",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137644164

Growing petroleum shortages and global climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions have given an impetus to the development of renewable and low-carbon energy sources. Fatty acid-derived hydrocarbons are an attractive drop-in biofuel to substitute fossil fuels consumed by the transport sector, especially heavy vehicles. Compared to traditional biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel, fatty acid-derived hydrocarbons have higher energy density and better compatibility with existing storage and transport systems. As a common microbial platform for biofuel production, yeasts have been engineered to produce fatty acid-derived hydrocarbons. Here, we attempted to comprehensively review the latest advances in metabolic engineering strategies for the production of fatty acid-derived hydrocarbons in the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica. The heterologous hydrocarbon synthesis pathways and combinational metabolic engineering strategies have been summarized, followed by a discussion of future research directions for the development of yeasts as industrial hydrocarbon producers. © 2022 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Biofuel; Fatty acid; Hydrocarbon; Metabolic engineering; Yeast",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137617166

To develop redox catalysts with superior performance for soot combustion, a series of MnxCoy oxides were synthesized using MgO template substitution. This method greatly improves the preparation and catalytic efficiency and is more in line with the current theme of green catalysts and sustainable development. The resulting Mn1Co2.3 has a strong activation capability of gaseous oxygen due to a high concentration of Co3+ and Mn3+. The Mn doping enhanced the intrinsic activity by prompting oxygen vacancy formation and gaseous oxygen adsorption. The nanosheet morphology with abundant mesoporous significantly increased the solid–solid contact efficiency and improved the adsorption capability of gaseous reactants. The novel design of Mn1Co2.3 oxide enhanced its catalytic performance through a synergistic effect of Mn doping and the porous nanosheet morphology, showing significant potential for the preparation of high-performance soot combustion catalysts. © 2022 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences","Contact efficiency; DFT; Intrinsic activity; Mn doping; Soot combustion","Catalysts; Combustion; Design for testability; Dust; Energy efficiency; Magnesia; Manganese oxide; Morphology; Oxygen; Oxygen vacancies; Soot; Sustainable development; Catalytic process; Contact efficiency; DFT; Energy efficiency sustainability; Facile preparation; Gaseous oxygen; Intrinsic activities; Mn-doping; Performance; Soot combustion; Nanosheets",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137614591

The principle, which is deeply embedded in environmental law, policymaking and governance, drives environmentally destructive neoliberal economic growth that exploits and degrades the vulnerable living order. Despite seemingly well-meaning intentions behind the emergence of sustainable development, it almost invariably facilitates exploitative economic development activities that exacerbate systemic inequalities and injustices without noticeably protecting all life forms in the Anthropocene. We conclude the article by examining an attempt to construct alternatives to sustainable development through the indigenous onto-epistemology of buen vivir. While no panacea, buen vivir is a worldview that offers the potential to critically rethink how environmental law could re-orientate away from its ‘centered’, gendered and anthropocentric, neoliberal sustainable development ontology, to a radically different ontology that embraces ecologically sustainable ways of seeing, being, knowing and caring. © 2022, The Author(s).","Anthropocene; Buen vivir; Developmentalism; Ecological sustainability; Environmental governance; International environmental law; Neoliberalism; Sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goals",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137613095

However, these technical “fixes” may ultimately prove to be dangerous shortcuts that do little to address the concerns of irrigators, Indigenous People, environmental groups, and local communities about water scarcity, access, security, and sustainability. In the absence of transparent and rigorous governance safeguards, irrigation efficiency upgrades can result in higher water consumption, demand, and ultimately, increased water scarcity. Upgraded irrigation systems also tend to capture return flows and redistribute them to “high value” consumptive water uses, potentially displacing other users and uses, including Indigenous Peoples. In this article, we critique current approaches to governing irrigation efficiency, using a water justice lens to identify four key insights and their implications for governance.
